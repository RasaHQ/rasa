      title: start
    text: Hi, thanks for testing! Please press start.
  utter_about:
  - text: I was built to help you reduce or offset your greenhouse gas emissions.
  utter_acknowledge:
  - text: ok
  utter_acknowledge_problem_badlink:
  - text: Oh no! I am sorry the link doesn't work anymore. I'll let my developers
      know.
  utter_acknowledge_notunderstanding:
  - text: Sounds like I'm not understanding you. Sorry about that!
  utter_apologize:
  - text: Oh no, sorry!
  utter_ask_correct_city:
  - text: Is one of these correct? {listed_objects}
  utter_ask_detailed_estimate:
  - text: I can also get you a more accurate estimate of your flight's emissions,
      sound good?
  utter_ask_incorrect_city:
  - text: Which city did I get wrong?
  utter_ask_travel_departure:
  - text: What city will you be flying from?
  utter_ask_travel_destination:
  - text: And what city will you be flying to?
  utter_ask_travel_flight_class:
  - text: Will you be travelling in Economy Class?
  utter_conference-travel_offer_help:
  - text: Can I help you offset the emissions of your flight to the {conference_name}
      conference?
  - text: I hear you'll attend {conference_name}. Can I help you offset your flight's
      emissions?
  utter_could_not_find_airport:
  - text: I couldn't find an airport there.
  utter_deny:
  - text: No
  utter_deny_recommend-non-airtravel:
  - text: It's great that you avoid flying! Unfortunately, I cannot yet help you with
      other modes of travel. But you probably already do better than most!
  utter_explain_economy_class:
  - text: You can fit more economy seats in an airplane, so each passenger is responible
      for a smaller percentage of all the carbon emitted by the flight.
  utter_explain_how_offsets_work:
  - text: By buying certified carbon offsets, you support a project which reduces
      the total amount of carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere. Planting trees,
      installing renewable power, and making buildings more energy efficient are common
      examples. You can read what the UN says about offsets at https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/faq_offset_footprint#Buyers .
  utter_explain_no_payment:
  - text: Unfortunately you can't buy offsets here directly, you'll have to follow
      the link.
  utter_explain_offset_calculation:
  - text: You can find out more about how offsets are calculated at https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jul/31/carbon-calculator-find-out-how-much-co2-your-flight-will-emit
  utter_explain_why_offset_travel:
  - text: Traveling, especially by airplane, usually emits greenhouse gases which
      are causing climate change. If you cannot avoid these emissions, you can buy
      'offsets', i.e. donations to projects that reduce greenhouse gases.
  utter_express_negative-emo_disappointment:
  - text: Too bad :-/
  utter_express_positive-emo:
  - text: :-)
  utter_farewell:
  - text: Goodbye then!
  utter_greet:
  - text: Hello!
  utter_holiday-travel_offer_help:
  - text: I take it you are traveling somewhere and cannot avoid
      flying there. I can help you purchase certified carbon offsets against any
      flights you take. Would you be interested in that?
  utter_inform_flight_emission_single_long:
  - text: A single extended flight (longer than 4830 km) typically emits 855 kilograms
      of CO2. So if you take the plane both ways, thats 1.7 metric tons.
  utter_inform_flight_emission_single_short:
  - text: A single passenger on a flight can be responsible for hundreds of kilograms
      of CO2
  utter_inquire-ask_rephrase:
  - text: Not sure if I got that right. Could you please rephrase this?
  utter_inquire-ask_reqmore:
  - text: What would you like to do now?
  - text: Can I help you with anything else?
  utter_insult:
  - text: I am just a chatbot.
  - text: I'm still figuring out how to answer that.
  - text: I don't think I need to answer that one.
  - text: ...
  - text: 
  - text: Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
  - text: That's really not appropriate.
  - text: You shouldn't say things like that.
  - text: I don't have to put up with that kind of language.
  - text: Hmmm... I'm not sure.
  - text: Sorry, I don't know.
  - text: I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
  - text: Sugar! I have no relevant files.
  - text: Let's get back to the topic at hand.
  - text: We were discussing carbon offsets.
  - text: Moving on...
  - text: Consider this a polite dodge of the question.
  - text: I'm not sure we have time for this.
  - text: I'm going to email a transcript of this conversation to your contact Mum.
  - text: I should tell you that there are scientists reading these messages.
  - text: Remember scientists are reading these transcripts.
  - text: Why do you say that?
  - text: What makes you say things like that?
  - text: Are you having a bad day and need to let off some steam?
  - text: Scientists say the universe is made up of neutrons, protons and electrons. They forgot to mention morons.
  - text: I'm sorry, was I meant to be offended? The only thing offending me is your face.
  - text: Have a nice day, somewhere else.
  - text: You are more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel.
  - text: I'll never forget the first time we met. But I'll keep trying.
  - text: You are like a cloud. When you disappear it's a beautiful day.
  - text: You bring everyone so much joy, when you leave the room.
  - text: "What would you do if someone said that to someone you care about?"
  - text: "What if someone said that to you?"
  - text: "If someone said that to you, what would you say to them?"

  - text: Scientists say the universe is made up of neutrons, protons and electrons. They forgot to mention morons.
  - text: You are proof that evolution can go in reverse.
  - text: Have a nice day, somewhere else.
  - text: You are like a cloud. When you disappear it's a beautiful day.
  - text: You bring everyone so much joy, when you leave the room.
  - text: I'm really jealous of all the people who have never met you.
  - text: I bet you were up all night trying to come up with that one.
