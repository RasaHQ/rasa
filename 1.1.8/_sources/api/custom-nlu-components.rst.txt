Custom NLU Components
=====================

You can create a custom component to perform a specific task which NLU doesn't currently offer (for example, sentiment analysis).
Below is the specification of the :class:`rasa.nlu.components.Component` class with the methods you'll need to implement.

.. note::
    There is a detailed tutorial on building custom components `here
    <https://blog.rasa.com/enhancing-rasa-nlu-with-custom-components/>`_.


You can add a custom component to your pipeline by adding the module path.
So if you have a module called ``sentiment``
containing a ``SentimentAnalyzer`` class:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        pipeline:
        - name: "sentiment.SentimentAnalyzer"


Also be sure to read the section on the :ref:`section_component_lifecycle`.

To get started, you can use this skeleton that contains the most important
methods that you should implement:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/nlu/example_component.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
