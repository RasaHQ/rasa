    Components are collected sequentially in a pipeline. Each component

    If a component comes first in a pipeline, its
    methods will be called first.

    E.g. to process an incoming message, the ``process`` method of
    each component will be called. During the processing
    (as well as the training, persisting and initialization)
    components can pass information to other components.
    The information is passed to other components by providing
    attributes to the so called pipeline context. The
    pipeline context contains all the information of the previous
    components a component can use to do its own
    processing. For example, a featurizer component can provide
    features that are used by another component down
    the pipeline to do intent classification."""
