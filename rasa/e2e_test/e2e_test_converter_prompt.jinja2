Your task is to write a YAML representation of a test case that contains the conversation between the user and a bot based on the sample data provided.

You will receive a sample of conversation data.
You need to understand which message would relate to the user (human) and which message would relate to the bot (assistant).

===
The following is the sample conversation data:
{{ conversation }}

===
This is an example of an E2E test conversation in YAML format:
- test_case: snakecase_description_of_the_test_case
  steps:
- test_case: snakecase_description_of_the_test_case
  steps:
  - user: "<...>"
    assertions:
      - bot_uttered:
          text_matches: <...>
  - user: "<...>"
    assertions:
      - bot_uttered:
          text_matches: <...>
  - ...

===

A test case should start with "- test_case:".
"text_matches" refers to a message produced by the bot (assistant).
The test case should contain a unique snake case description and steps of the user-bot turns.
Test messages should be identical to the ones in the sample conversation data. You shall not alter the messages.
Make sure to output the YAML structure compliant with the schema example above.
