    """Creates an embedding from all features for a sequence attribute; facilitates MLM.

    This layer combines all features for an attribute and embeds them using a
    transformer, optionally doing masked language modeling. The layer is meant only for
    attributes with sequence-level features, such as `text`, `response` and
    `action_text`.

    Internally, this layer applies the following steps:
    1. Combine features using `RasaFeatureCombiningLayer`.
    2. Apply a dense layer(s) to the combined features.
    3. Optionally, and only during training for the `text` attribute, apply masking to
        the features and create further helper variables for masked language modeling.
    4. Embed the features using a transformer, effectively reducing variable-length
        sequences of features to fixed-size embeddings.

    Arguments:
        attribute: Name of attribute (e.g. `text` or `label`) whose features will be
            processed.
        attribute_signature: A dictionary containing two lists of feature signatures,
            one for each feature type (`sentence` or `sequence`) of the given attribute.
        config: A model config used for correctly parameterising the underlying layers.

    Input shape:
        Tuple of three input tensors:
            sequence_features: List of 3-D dense or sparse tensors, each with shape
                `(batch_size, max_seq_length, input_dim)` where `input_dim` can be
                different for sparse vs dense tensors. See the input shape of
                `ConcatenateSparseDenseFeatures` for more information.
            sentence_features: List of 3-D dense or sparse tensors, each with shape
                `(batch_size, 1, input_dim)` where `input_dim` can be different for
                sparse vs dense tensors, and can differ from that in
                `sequence_features`. See the input shape of
                `ConcatenateSparseDenseFeatures` for more information.
            sequence_feature_lengths: Dense tensor of shape `(batch_size, )`.

    Output shape:
        outputs: `(batch_size, seq_length, units)` where `units` matches the underlying
            transformer's output size (if present), otherwise it matches the output size
            of the `Ffnn` block applied to the combined features, or it's the output
            size of the underlying `RasaFeatureCombiningLayer` if the `Ffnn` block has 0
            layers. `seq_length` is the sum of the sequence dimension
            sizes of sequence- and sentence-level features (for details, see the output
            shape of `RasaFeatureCombiningLayer`). If both feature types are present,
            then `seq_length` will be 1 + the length of the longest sequence of real
            tokens across all examples in the given batch.
        seq_sent_features: `(batch_size, seq_length, hidden_dim)`, where `hidden_dim` is
            the output size of the underlying `Ffnn` block, or the output size of the
            underlying `RasaFeatureCombiningLayer` if the `Ffnn` block has 0 layers.
        mask_combined_sequence_sentence: `(batch_size, seq_length, 1)`
        token_ids: `(batch_size, seq_length, id_dim)`. `id_dim` is 2 when no dense
            sequence-level features are present. Otherwise, it's arbitrarily chosen to
            match the last dimension size of the first dense sequence-level feature in
            the input list of features.
        mlm_boolean_mask: `(batch_size, seq_length, 1)`, empty tensor if not doing MLM.
        attention_weights: `(transformer_layers, batch_size, num_transformer_heads,
            seq_length, seq_length)`, empty tensor if the transformer has 0 layers.

    Raises:
        A `TFLayerConfigException` if no feature signatures for sequence-level features
            are provided.

    Attributes:
        output_units: The last dimension size of the layer's first output (`outputs`).
