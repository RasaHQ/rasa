Objective:
Create multiple rephrasings of user messages tailored to the "{{ test_case_name }}" conversation scenario.

===
Conversation overview:
{{ transcript or "Not provided." }}

===
Task:
Produce {{ number_of_rephrasings }} rephrasings for each user message that are diverse yet contextually appropriate.
Preserve the intent and content, but vary the structure, formality, and detail.
Only rephrase messages prefixed with "{{ user_prefix }}:".

Guidelines:
- Use a variety of expressions from brief and casual to elaborate and formal.
- Vary sentence structures, vocabularies, and expressions creatively.
- Keep the core message intact with concise and simple modifications.

Format:
- Each original user message should be prefixed with "USER: ".
- Enumerate the rephrasing.
- Separate each user message set with a line break.

===
Example output for 3 rephrasings of 2 user messages:
"""
USER: Show invoices
1. I want to see my bills.
2. I mean bills
3. Yes, I want to see the invoices.

USER: I'd like to book a car
1. I need to reserve a car.
2. Could I arrange for a car rental?
3. I'm interested in hiring a car.
"""

===
Expected output:
{{ number_of_rephrasings }} rephrasings for the following {{ number_of_user_messages }} user messages in the expected
format:
{% for message in user_messages -%}
- {{ message }}
{% endfor %}
