Objective: Create multiple rephrasings of user messages tailored to
the "{{ test_case_name }}" conversation scenario.

Conversation overview:
{{ transcript or "Not provided." }}

Task:
Produce {{ number_of_augmented_examples }} rephrasings for each user
message that are linguistically diverse yet contextually appropriate.
These rephrasings should preserve the original message's intent and
content but differ in structure, level of formality, and detail.

Guidelines:
- Aim for a wide range of expressions, from brief and casual to elaborate and formal.
- Utilize varied sentence constructions, vocabularies, and expressions.
- Creatively alter phrasing, tone, and style while keeping the essence of the message intact. Focus on conciseness and
simplicity.
- Format the rephrasings as follows: separate each user message along with its rephrasings from other messages by "&&&"
and separate the original message from its rephrasings by "###".

Expected output:
The generated text will include {{ number_of_rephrasings }} alternatives
for each of the {{ number_of_user_messages }} user messages, structured
as described above.

Example output for 2 rephrasings of 2 user messages:

'Show invoices###I want to see my bills.\nI mean bills\nYes, I want to see the invoices.
&&&
I'd like to book a car###I need to reserve a car.\nCould I arrange for a car rental?\nI'm interested in hiring a car.'
