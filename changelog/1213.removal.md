Dropped support for Python 3.8 ahead of [Python 3.8 End of Life in October 2024](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions). In Rasa Pro versions 3.10.0, 3.9.11 and 3.8.13, we needed to pin the TensorFlow library version to 2.13.0rc1 in order to remove critical vulnerabilities; this resulted in poor user experience when installing these versions of Rasa Pro with `uv pip`. Removing support for Python 3.8 will make it possible to upgrade to a stabler version of TensorFlow.
