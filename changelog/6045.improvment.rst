We updated the way how we save and use features in our NLU pipeline.

The message object now has a dedicated field, called ``features``, to store the features that are generated in the NLU
pipeline. We adapted all our featurizers in a way that sequence and sentence features are stored independently.
This allows us to keep different kind of features for the sequence and the sentence. For example, the
``LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer`` does not produce any sentence features anymore as our experiments showed that those did
not bring any performance gain just quite a lot of additional values to store.

We also modified the DIET architecture to process the sequence and sentence features independently at first.
The features are concatenated just before the transformer.

We also removed the ``__CLS__`` token again. Our Tokenizers will not add this token anymore.
