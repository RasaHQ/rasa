Implement as part of E2E testing a new type of evaluation specifically designed to increase confidence in CALM.
This evaluation runs assertions on the assistant's actual events and generative responses. 
New assertions include the ability to check for the presence of specific events, such as:
- flow started, flow completed or flow cancelled events
- whether `pattern_clarification` was triggered for specific flows 
- whether buttons rendered well as part of the bot uttered event
- whether slots were set correctly or not
- whether the bot text response matches a provided regex pattern
- whether the bot response matches a provided domain response name

These assertions can be specified for user steps only and cannot be used alongside the former E2E test format.
You can learn more about this new feature in the documentation.

To enable this feature, please set the environment variable `RASA_PRO_BETA_E2E_ASSERTIONS` to `true`.
```
export RASA_PRO_BETA_E2E_ASSERTIONS=true
```
