Implemented custom action stubbing for E2E test cases. To define custom action stubs, add `stub_custom_actions` to the test case file.

Stubs can be defined in two ways:
- Test file level: Define each action by its name (`action_name`).
- Test case level: Define the stub using the test case ID as a prefix (`test_case_id::action_name`).

To learn more about this feature, please refer to the [documentation](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/production/testing-your-assistant#stubbing-custom-actions).

To enable this feature, set the environment variable `RASA_PRO_BETA_STUB_CUSTOM_ACTION` to `true`:

```
export RASA_PRO_BETA_STUB_CUSTOM_ACTION=true
```
