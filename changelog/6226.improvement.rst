Added more debugging logs to the :ref:`lock-stores` to simplify debugging in case of
connection problems.

Added a new parameter ``socket_timeout`` to the ``RedisLockStore``. If Redis doesn't
answer within ``socket_timeout`` seconds to requests from Rasa Open Source, an error
is raised. This avoids seemingly infinitely blocking connections and exposes connection
problems early.
