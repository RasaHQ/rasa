Due to change in the model architecture the behavior of `rasa train --dry-run` changed.
The exit codes now have the following meaning:

* `0 means that the model does not require an expensive retraining. However, the 
  responses might still require updating by running `rasa train`
* `1` means that one or multiple components require to be retrained.
* `8` means that the `--force` flag was used and hence any cached results are ignored
  and the entire model is retrained.
