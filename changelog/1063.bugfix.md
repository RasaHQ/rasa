Mark the first slot event as seen when the user turn in a E2E test case contains multiple slot events for the same slot.
This fixes the issue when the `assertion_order_enabled` is set to `true` and the user step in a test case contained
multiple `slot_was_set` assertions for the same slot, the last slot event was marked as seen when the first assertion was running.
This caused the test to fail for subsequent `slot_was_set` assertions for the same slot with error `Slot <slot_name> was not set`.
