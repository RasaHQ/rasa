Revert the old behavior when loading trained model by supplying a path to the model on the remote storage
by using the model path (`-m`) argument when `REMOTE_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable is not set.
Resulting path on the remote storage will be the same as the model path (`-m`) argument.

Additionally, entire model path (`-m`) argument wil be used when trained model is being uploaded to the 
remote storage with `REMOTE_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable not set.
Resulting path on the remote storage will be the same as the model path (`-m`) argument.

If `REMOTE_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable is set, only the file name part of the model path (`-m`) argument
is used in both loading and storage from/to the remote storage. Resulting path on the remote storage will be:
`REMOTE_STORAGE_PATH` + file name part of the model path (`-m`) argument.
