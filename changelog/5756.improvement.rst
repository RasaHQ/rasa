To avoid the problem of our entity extractors predicting entity labels for just a part of the words,
we introduced a cleaning method after the prediction was done.
We should avoid the incorrect prediction in the first place.
To achieve this we will not tokenize words into sub-words anymore.
We take the mean feature vectors of the sub-words as the feature vector of the word.
