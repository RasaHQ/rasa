Implemented model checkpointing for DIET. The best DIET model during training will be stored instead of just the last model. The model is evaluated on the basis of `evaluate_every_number_of_epochs`.

Checkpointing is enabled iff the following is set for the `DIETClassifier` in the `config.yml` file:
* `checkpoint_model: True`
* `evaluate_on_number_of_examples > 0`

The model is stored to whatever location has been specified with the `--out` parameter when calling `rasa train nlu ...`.
