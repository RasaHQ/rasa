- **LiteLLM Integration & Reduced LangChain Reliance:**
  - Introduced `LLMClient` and `EmbeddingClient` protocols for standardized client interfaces.
  - Created lightweight client wrappers for LiteLLM to streamline model instantiation, management, and inference.
  - Updated `llm_factory` and `embedder_factory` to utilize these LiteLLM client wrappers.
  - Added dedicated clients for Azure OpenAI and OpenAI to support both LLMs and embedding models.
  - Added a HuggingFace client to compute embeddings using locally stored transformer models via the `sentence-transformers` package.
- **LangChain Update:** Upgraded to the latest version (0.2.x) for improved compatibility and features.
