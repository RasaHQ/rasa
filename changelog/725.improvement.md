The `LLMCommandGenerator` component has been renamed to `SingleStepLLMCommandGenerator`. There is no change to the functionality.
    
Using the `LLMCommandGenerator` as the name of the component results in a deprecation warning as it will be permanently renamed to `SingleStepLLMCommandGenerator` in 4.0.0. Please modify the assistant’s configuration to use the `SingleStepLLMCommandGenerator` instead of the `LLMCommandGenerator` to avoid seeing the deprecation warning.
