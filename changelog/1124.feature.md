You can now produce a coverage report of your e2e tests via the following command:

```commandline
rasa test e2e <e2e-test-folder> --coverage-report [--coverage-output-path <output-folder>]
```

The coverage report contains the number of steps and the number of tested steps per flow. Untested steps are
referenced by line numbers.

```commandline
Flow Name Coverage  Num Steps  Missing Steps  Line Numbers
   flow_1    0.00%          1              1       [10-10]
   flow_2  100.00%          4              0            []
    Total   80.00%          5              1                      
```

Additionally, we also create a histogram of command coverage showing how many and what
commands are produced in your e2e tests.

To enable this feature, please set the environment variable `RASA_PRO_BETA_FINETUNING_RECIPE` to `true`.

```
export RASA_PRO_BETA_FINETUNING_RECIPE=true
```
