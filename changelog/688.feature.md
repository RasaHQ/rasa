Enable slot filling in a CALM assistant to be configurable:
- either use NLU-based predefined slot mappings that instructs `NLUCommandAdapter` to issue SetSlot commands with values extracted from the user input via an entity extractor or intent classifier
- or use the new predefined slot mapping `from_llm` which enables LLM-based command generators to issue SetSlot commands
If no slot mapping is defined, the default behavior is to use the `from_llm` slot mapping.
