Enable slot filling in a CALM assistant to be configurable:
- either use nlu-based predefined slot mappings that instructs `NLUCommandAdapter` to issue SetSlot commands with values extracted from the user input via an entity extractor or intent classifier
- or use the new predefined slot mapping `FROM_LLM` which enables LLM-based command generators to issue SetSlot commands
If no slot mapping is defined, the default behavior is to use the `FROM_LLM` slot mapping.
