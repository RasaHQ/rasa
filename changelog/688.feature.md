Enable slot filling in a CALM assistant to be configurable:
- either use NLU-based predefined slot mappings that instructs `NLUCommandAdapter` to issue SetSlot commands with values extracted from the user input via an entity extractor or intent classifier
- or use the new predefined slot mapping `from_llm` which enables LLM-based command generators to issue SetSlot commands
If no slot mapping is defined, the default behavior is to use the `from_llm` slot mapping.

In case you had been using `custom` slot mapping type for slots set with the prediction of the LLM-based command generator, you need to
update your assistant configuration to use the new `from_llm` slot mapping type.
Note that even if you have written custom slot validation actions (following the `validate_<slot_name>` convention)
for slots set by the LLM-based command generator, you need to update your assistant configuration to use the new `from_llm` slot mapping type.

For [slots that are set only via the custom action](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/concepts/domain#custom-slot-mappings)
e.g. slots set by external sources only, you need to add the action name to the slot mapping:

```yaml
slots:
  slot_name:
    type: text
    mappings:
      - type: custom
        action: custom_action_name
```
