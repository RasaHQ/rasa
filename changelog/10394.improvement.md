Allow single tokens in rasa end-to-end test files to be annotated with multiple entities.

Some entity extractors (s.a. `RegexEntityExtractor`) can generate multiple entities from a single expression. Before this change, `rasa test` would fail in this case, because test stories could not be annotated correctly.
New annotation option is  
```YAML
stories:
  - story: Some story
    steps:
      - user: |
          cancel my [iphone][{"entity":"iphone", "value":"iphone"},{"entity":"smartphone", "value":"true"}{"entity":"mobile_service", "value":"true"}] 
        intent: cancel_contract
```
