Implement E2E testing assertions that measure metrics such as grounded-ness and answer relevance of generative responses
issued by either Enterprise Search or the Contextual Response Rephraser.

You must specify a threshold which must be reached for the generative evaluation assertion to pass.
In addition, you can also specify `ground_truth` if you prefer providing this in the E2E test rather than relying on the 
retrieved context from the vector store (in the case of Enterprise Search) or from the domain (in the case
of Contextual Response Rephraser) that is stored in the bot utterance event metadata.
For rephrased answers, you must specify `utter_name` to run the assertion.

These assertions can be specified for user steps only and cannot be used alongside the former E2E test format.
You can learn more about this new feature in the documentation.

To enable this feature, please set the environment variable `RASA_PRO_BETA_E2E_ASSERTIONS` to `true`.
```
export RASA_PRO_BETA_E2E_ASSERTIONS=true
```
