Implemented an optimization to reduce payload size by ensuring the Assistant sends the domain dictionary to the Action Server only once, which the server then stores. If the Action Server responds with a 449 status code indicating a missing domain context, the Assistant will repeat the API request including the domain dictionary in the payload, ensuring the server properly saves this data.
