Configure LLM E2E test converter settings in the `llm_e2e_test_converter` section of the `conftest.yml` file.

These settings will be used to configure the LLM used to convert sample conversation data into E2E test cases.

The `conftest.yml` is discoverable as long as it is in the root directory of the tests output path or sample conversation data path.

If the `conftest.yml` file is not present in the root directory, the default LLM settings will be used.
