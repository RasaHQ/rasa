Enable training with bot config stored as `.tar.gz` archive on remote storage.
Archive should contain all files necessary for training. 
Once fetched from remote storage, content of the archive will be extracted to the current working directory before training.
Training with remote bot config is supported if `--remote-storage` flag is set.
- Add `--remote_bot_config_path` argument to `train` command to specify the path to the bot config stored on remote storage.
