        When added to Core, it will provide you an endpoint at
        `/webhooks/rest/webhook` that returns the same output as
        this endpoint. The only difference is, that you need to
        send the message as `{"message": "<your text to parse>"}`.

        Notify the dialogue engine that the user posted a new message,
        and get a list of response messages the bot should send back.
