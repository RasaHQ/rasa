Rasa as open source alternative to IBM Watson - Migration Tips
==============================================================

.. raw:: html

     There is no support for IBM Watson yet. However, a group of community members is working on a way to use <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/learn-how-to-export-import-a-watson-assistant-workspace/" target="_blank">exported IBM Watson workspaces</a> in Rasa. If you're interested in that, check out our <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.rasa.com/" target="_blank">Community Forum</a>.


At Rasa, we hear a few different reasons why developers switch from cloud-based tools like IBM Watson:

* **Faster**: Runs locally - no https requests and server round trips required
* **Customizable**: Tune models and get higher accuracy with your data set
* **Open source**: No risk of vendor lock-in - the Rasa Stack comes with an Apache 2.0 licence and you can use it in commercial projects

     In addition, our open source tools allow developers to build contextual AI assistants and manage dialogues with machine learning instead of rules - learn more in <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.rasa.com/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.
