# Docs

The docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Deployment is handled by Netlify: it is setup for listening to changes on the `documentation` branch.
