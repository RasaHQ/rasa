This section helps you get started with analyzing your assistant's conversations.
The examples use SQL queries together with an example visualization in Metabase.

For more metrics and categories of conversations,
see [Types of metrics](./getting-started-with-analytics.mdx#types-of-metrics).


<!--
The queries below are taken from a dashboard in Metabase:
https://rasa-technologies-gmbh.metabaseapp.com/dashboard/3-example-queries-for-the-docs

Please note that, given the data in the Metabase instance, we had to cheat and modify
the HTML of the graphs before taking the screenshots, otherwise we'd have data from
2020 instead of 2022.

Please also note that some SQL queries in this page are not simple copy-paste from
Metabase queries because we used filters in Metabase to remove the noise and make
the graphs look nice.

Please make sure that these SQL queries are kept in sync with the dashboard, it'll
make your colleagues' work next time easier :).

## Number of sessions per month

A common high-level usage metric of your assistant is the number of
sessions per month. Here is how it would look as an SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', "public"."rasa_session"."timestamp") AS "first_seen",
  count(*) AS "count"
FROM "public"."rasa_session"
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 ASC
```

<figure align="center">
  <img
    alt="Number of sessions per month visualized in Metabase."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/graph-number-sessions-month.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
  <figcaption>Number of sessions per month visualized in Metabase.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Number of sessions per channel

If you're connecting your assistant to multiple channels, it could be
useful to look at the number of sessions per channel, let's say per week.
The query you would need for this metric is:

```sql
SELECT
  "public"."rasa_sender"."channel" AS "channel",
  "public"."rasa_sender"."first_seen" AS "timestamp",
  count(distinct "public"."rasa_sender"."sender_key") AS "count"
FROM "public"."rasa_sender"
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 ASC, 2 ASC
```

<figure align="center">
  <img
    alt="Number of sessions per channel visualized in Metabase."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/graph-number-sessions-channel.png")}
    width="100%"
  />

## Top N intents

To improve your assistant, you could look into the variety of intents
your users express. The query below selects the top 5 intents which
could help you have a good perspective on that topic:

```sql
SELECT
  "public"."rasa_user_message"."intent" AS "intent",
  count(*) AS "count"
FROM "public"."rasa_user_message"
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1 ASC
LIMIT 5
```

<figure align="center">
  <img
    alt="Top 5 intents visualized in Metabase."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/graph-top-5-intents.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
  <figcaption>Top 5 intents visualized in Metabase.</figcaption>
</figure>

Moreover, you can look for the intent distribution over time:

```sql
SELECT
  "public"."rasa_user_message"."intent" AS "intent",
  date_trunc('month', "public"."rasa_user_message"."timestamp") AS "timestamp",
  count(*) AS "count" FROM "public"."rasa_user_message"
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 ASC, 2 ASC
```

<figure align="center">
  <img
    alt="Intent distribution over time visualized in Metabase."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/graph-intent-distribution.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
  <figcaption>Intent distribution over time visualized in Metabase.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Escalation rate

The escalation rate or human hand-off rate is a measure of the number of
conversations the assistant passes to a human agent. This metric can
help you gain a better understanding of what happens during a conversation.
Let's say you have an intent named `handoff_to_support`. You'll get the
escalation rate over time with this sample query:

```sql
WITH "sessions" AS (
    SELECT
        "public"."rasa_user_message"."session_id" AS "session_id",
        date_trunc('month', "public"."rasa_user_message"."timestamp") AS "timestamp",
        (
          CASE "public"."rasa_user_message"."intent"
            WHEN 'handoff_to_support'
            THEN 1 ELSE 0
          END
        ) AS "has_handoff_to_support"
    FROM "public"."rasa_user_message"
),
"sessions_with_handoff" AS (
    SELECT
      "session_id",
      "timestamp",
      SUM("has_handoff_to_support") AS "has_handoff_to_support"
    FROM "sessions"
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT
  "timestamp",
  SUM("has_handoff_to_support") / count(*) AS "escalation_rate"
FROM "sessions_with_handoff"
GROUP BY 1 ASC
ORDER BY 1 ASC
```

    alt="Escalation rate visualized in Metabase."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/graph-escalation-rate.png")}
    width="100%"
  />

## Abandonment rate

Abandonment rate can be defined in many different custom ways,
however here we'll define it as a session ending without a user message
after a specific message was uttered by the bot, e.g. `utter_ask_name`.
You could adapt the metric to detect sessions ending without a user
message after a specific set of intents. The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
WITH "sessions" AS (
    SELECT
        DISTINCT ON ("public"."rasa_event"."session_id") "public"."rasa_event"."session_id",
        "public"."rasa_event"."timestamp" AS "timestamp",
        (
            CASE
                WHEN "public"."rasa_bot_message"."template_name" = 'utter_ask_name'
                THEN 1 ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS "is_abandoned"
    FROM "public"."rasa_event"
    INNER JOIN "public"."rasa_bot_message"
      ON "public"."rasa_event"."id" = "public"."rasa_bot_message"."event_id"
    WHERE "public"."rasa_event"."event_type" = 'bot'
    ORDER BY 1, 2 DESC
)
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', "timestamp") AS "timestamp",
  SUM("is_abandoned")::float / count(*) AS "abandonment_rate"
FROM "sessions"
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 ASC
```

<figure align="center">

    alt="Abandonment rate visualized in Metabase."
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/analytics/graph-abandonment-rate.png")}
    width="100%"
  />
