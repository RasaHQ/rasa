Analytics Data Pipeline helps visualize and process Rasa assistant metrics in the
tooling (BI tools, data warehouses) of your choice. Visualizations
and analysis of the production assistant and its conversations allow
you to assess ROI and improve the performance of the assistant over time.

Measuring a Rasa assistant's success and making strategic investments
will lead to better business outcomes. It will also help you understand
the needs of your end users and better serve them.

Rasa Pro will connect to your production assistant using Kafka.
The pipeline will compute analytics as soon as the docker container
is successfully deployed and connected to your data warehouse and
Kafka instances.

## Types of metrics

Metrics collected from your assistant can broadly be categorized as

- User Analytics: Who are the users of the assistant, and how do they feel
about it?  Examples: demographics, channels, sentiment analysis
- Usage Analytics:  How is the assistantâ€™s overall health and what kind of
traffic is coming to it?  Examples:  total number of sessions, time per
session, errors and error rates
- Conversation Analytics: What happened during the conversation?
Examples: number of messages sent, abandonment depth, number of topics
introduced by user, top N intents
- Business Analytics: How is the assistant performing with regard to business goals?
Examples: ROI of assistant per LoB, time comparison of assistant vs agent, containment rate

In this version of the Analytics pipeline, measurement of the following metrics
is possible

| Metric | Category | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Number of conversations| Usage Analytics | Total number of conversations |
| Number of users | Usage Analytics | Total number of users |
| Number of sessions | Usage Analytics | Gross traffic to assistant |
| Channels used | Usage Analytics | Sessions by channel |
| User session count | User Analytics | Total number of user sessions or average sessions per user |
| Top N intents | Conversation Analytics | Top intents across all users |
| Avg response time | Conversation Analytics | Average response time for assistant |
| Containment rate | Business Analytics | % of conversations handled purely by assistant (not handed to human agent |
| Abandonment rate | Business Analytics | % of abandoned conversations |
| Escalation rate | Business Analytics | % of conversations escalated to human agent |


For examples of how you can extract these metrics,
see [Example queries](./example-queries.mdx).

## Prerequisites

- A production deployment of Kafka is required to set up Rasa Pro.
  We recommend using [Amazon Managed Streaming for
  Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/).
- A production deployment of a data lake needs to be connected to
  the data pipeline. Rasa Pro directly supports the following data lakes:

  - [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) (
    **recommended**. All PostgreSQL >= 11.0 are supported)
  - [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)

  Virtually any other data lakes can be configured to sync with your deployment of PostgreSQL.
  You can find additional instructions on how to connect your PostgreSQL deployment to either [BigQuery](#bigquery)
  or [Snowflake](#snowflake) in the [Connect a data warehouse step](#2-connect-a-data-warehouse).

  We recommend managed deployments of your data lake to minimize maintenance
  efforts.

## 1. Connect an assistant

To connect an assistant to Rasa Pro Services, you need to connect the assistant
to an event broker. The assistant will stream all events to the event broker,
which will then be consumed by Rasa Pro Services.

The configuration of the assistant is the first step of
[Installation and Configuration](./deploy/deploy-rasa-pro-services.mdx/#installation-and-configuration).
No additional configuration is required to connect the assistant to the
Analytics pipeline. After the assistant is deployed, the Analytics pipeline
will receive the data from the assistant and persist it to your
data warehouse which will be configured in the next step.

## 2. Connect a data warehouse

You can choose to configure the analytics pipeline to stream the
transformed conversational data to two different data warehouse types in AWS:

- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
- [Redshift](#redshift)

Additionally, any data warehouse is supported if it is configured in sync with
your deployment of PostgreSQL, [as recommended for Redshift](#streaming-from-postgresql-to-redshift).

We have included brief instructions for syncing your PostgreSQL deployment with:

- [BigQuery](#bigquery)
- [Snowflake](#snowflake)

### PostgreSQL

You can use Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) to create a PostgreSQL
DB instance which is the environment that will run your PostgreSQL database.

First, you must set up Amazon RDS by completing the instructions listed
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html).
Next, create the PostgreSQL DB instance. You can follow one of the
following instruction sets:

- the AWS _Easy create_ instructions listed in the [**Creating a PostgreSQL DB instance** section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html#CHAP_GettingStarted.Creating.PostgreSQL)
- the AWS [_Standard create_ instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html)

To build the DB URL in the DBAPI format specified in the
[**Connect an assistance** section](#connect-an-assistant) you must enter
the database credentials. You must obtain the database username and password
after you select a database authentication option during the process of
the PostgreSQL DB instance creation:

- **Password authentication** to use database credentials only, in which
  case you must enter a username for the master username, as well as generate
  the master password.
- [**Password and IAM DB authentication**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html)
  to use IAM users and roles for the authentication of database users.
- [**Password and Kerberos authentication**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/postgresql-kerberos.html)

Finally, when running the Analytics pipeline Docker container, set the
[environment variable `RASA_ANALYTICS_DB_URL`](../../deploy/deploy-rasa-pro-services.mdx#docker-container-configuration-reference)
to the PostgreSQL Amazon RDS DB instance URL.

### Redshift

If you prefer instead to set up Amazon Redshift as your choice of data lake,
you can choose to either stream the data from the PostgreSQL source database
within the Amazon RDS DB instance created at the [**PostgreSQL step**](#postgresql)
to the Redshift target or [connect directly](#direct-connection) to Amazon Redshift.

#### Streaming from PostgreSQL to Redshift

If you meet the [prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.Redshift.html#CHAP_Target.Redshift.Prerequisites)
for using an Amazon Redshift database as a target, you will need to implement two steps:

1. configure the PostgreSQL source for AWS Database Migration Service
   (DMS) by following these [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.html)
2. configure the Redshift target for AWS DMS following the instructions
   [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.Redshift.html).

#### Direct connection

You can get started on enabling the direct connection with Redshift by
following these resources on creating an [Amazon Redshift cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html).
Before you do so, you should take into account that streaming historical
data directly to Redshift could take much longer than streaming directly
to or via the PostgreSQL RDS instance.

You must update the `RASA_ANALYTICS_DB_URL` to the Redshift cluster DB URL
which must follow the following format:

```
redshift://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<AWS URL>:5439/<DB NAME>
```

For example:

```
redshift://awsuser:4324312adfaGQ@analytics.cp1yucixmagz.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/analytics
```

:::caution Redshift write performance

As a result of performance considerations, we strongly advise against
choosing a direct connection to Redshift. Redshift is a great data lake for
analytics but lacks the necessary write performance to directly stream data to it.

:::

### BigQuery

To stream data from PostgreSQL to BigQuery, you can use [Datastream for BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs).
Datastream for BigQuery supports several [PostgreSQL deployment types](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/configure-your-source-postgresql-database#overview),
including [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres).

Before you begin, make sure to check the Datastream [prerequisites](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/before-you-begin), as well as
additional Datastream networking connectivity [requirements](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/quickstart-replication-to-bigquery#requirements).

You can closely follow [this quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/quickstart-replication-to-bigquery) on replicating data from PostgreSQL CloudSQL to BigQuery with Datastream.

Alternatively, you can deep dive into the following Datastream set-up guides:

- [Configure your source PostgreSQL database](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/configure-your-source-postgresql-database)
- Optional: use [customer-managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/use-cmek)
- Create a [connection profile for PostgreSQL database](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/create-connection-profiles#cp4postgresdb)
- Create a [stream](https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/create-a-stream)

### Snowflake

You can sync your PostgreSQL deployment manually or via an automated [partner solution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ecosystem-etl.html).

The instructions for manual sync include the following steps:
- Extract data from PostgreSQL to file using `COPY INTO` [command](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.html).
  You should also explore the Snowflake [data loading best practices](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations.html) before extraction.
- Stage the extracted data files to either internal or external locations such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage or Microsoft Azure.
- Copy staged files to Snowflake tables using `COPY INTO` [command](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.html).
  You can decide to use [bulk data loading](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-bulk.html) into Snowflake or to load continuously using [Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe.html).
 Alternatively you can also benefit from [this plugin](https://cdap.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCS/pages/694157985/Cloud+Storage+to+Snowflake+Action) to load data to an existing Snowflake table.

## 3. Ingest past conversations (optional)

When Analytics is connected to your Kafka instance, it will consume
all prior events on the Kafka topic and ingest them into the database.
Kafka has a retention policy for events on a [topic which defaults to
7 days](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#topicconfigs_retention.ms).

If you want to process events from conversations that are older than the
retention policy configured for the Rasa topic, you can manually
ingest events from past conversations.

Manually ingesting data from past conversations requires a connection to the
tracker store. The tracker store contains past conversations and a
connection to the Kafka cluster. Use the `rasa export` command to export
the events stored in the tracker store to Kafka:

```shell
rasa export --endpoints endpoints.yml
```

Configure the export to read from your production tracker store
and write to Kafka as an event broker, e.g.

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
  tracker_store:
      type: SQL
      dialect: "postgresql"
      url: "localhost"
      db: "tracker"
      username: postgres
      password: password

  event_broker:
      type: kafka
      topic: rasa-events
      url: localhost:29092
      partition_by_sender: true
```

:::note

Running manual ingestion of past events multiple times will result in
duplicated events. There is currently no deduplication implemented in
Analytics. Every ingested event will be stored in the database,
even if it was processed previously.

## 4. Connect a BI Solution

Connecting a business intelligence platform to the data warehouse varies for
each platform. We provide example instructions for Metabase and Tableau but
you can use any BI platform which supports AWS Redshift or PostgreSQL.

### Example: Metabase

Metabase is a free and open-source business intelligence platform. It
provides a simple interface to query and visualize data. Metabase can
be connected to PostgreSQL or Redshift databases.

- [Connecting Metabase to PostgreSQL](https://www.metabase.com/data_sources/postgresql)
- [Connecting Metabase to Redshift](https://www.metabase.com/data_sources/amazon-redshift)

### Example: Tableau

Tableau is a business intelligence platform. It provides a flexible interface
to build business intelligence dashboards. Tableau can be connected to
PostgreSQL or Redshift databases.
