Let's get started with migrating your application from Dialogflow to Rasa (you can find a more detailed
tutorial <a className="reference external" href="http://blog.rasa.com/how-to-migrate-your-existing-google-dialogflow-assistant-to-rasa/" target="_blank">here</a>):

## Step 1: Export your data from Dialogflow

Navigate to your agent's settings by clicking the gear icon.



<img alt="Dialogflow Export" src={useBaseUrl("/img/dialogflow_export.png")} width="240" />

Click on the 'Export and Import' tab and click on the 'Export as ZIP' button.



<img alt="Dialogflow Export 2" src={useBaseUrl("/img/dialogflow_export_2.png")} width="675" />

This will download a file with a `.zip` extension. Unzip this file to create a folder.

## Step 2: Create a Rasa Project

To create a Rasa project, run:

```bash
rasa init
```

This will create a directory called `data`.
Remove the files in this directory, and
move your unzipped folder into this directory.

```bash
rm -r data/*
mv testagent data/
```

## Step 3: Train your NLU model

To train a model using your dialogflow data, run:

```bash
rasa train nlu
```

## Step 4: Test your NLU model

Let's see how your NLU model will interpret some test messages.
To start a testing session, run:

```bash
rasa shell nlu
```

This will prompt your for input.
Type a test message and press 'Enter'.
The output of your NLU model will be printed to the screen.
You can keep entering messages and test as many as you like.
Press 'control + C' to quit.

## Step 5: Start a Server with your NLU Model

To start a server with your NLU model, run:

```bash
rasa run
```

This will start a server listening on port 5005.

To send a request to the server, run:

```bash
curl 'localhost:5005/model/parse?emulation_mode=dialogflow' -d '{"text": "hello"}'
The `emulation_mode` parameter tells Rasa that you want your json
response to have the same format as you would get from dialogflow.
You can also leave it out to get the result in the usual Rasa format.

## Terminology:

The words `intent`, `entity`, and `utterance` have the same meaning in Rasa as they do in Dialogflow.
In Dialogflow, there is a concept called `Fulfillment`. In Rasa we call this a [Custom Action](./actions/.mdx#custom-actions).
