In this section you will learn how to install **Rasa Pro**, a drop-in replacement enterprise-ready version of Rasa Open Source, on your development environment.

To learn more about deployments, please visit the following sections:

- [Deploying Rasa Pro in production](../../deploy/deploy-rasa)
- [Deploying Rasa Pro Services in production](../../deploy/deploy-rasa-pro-services)

To learn more about compatibility between different versions of Rasa Pro and Rasa Pro Services, please see
[compatibility matrix](../../compatibility-matrix.mdx).

## Rasa Pro Setup

Rasa Pro requires access credentials to install and a license to use. The instructions below assume you have
credentials and a license.

Rasa Pro is a drop-in replacement and enterprise-ready version of Rasa Open Source.
Additional functionality is provided through plugins while allowing you to continue using the existing Rasa Open Source CLI commands and parameters as you used to.

Installing Rasa Pro instead of Rasa Open Source will not break any existing scripts, automation or functionality you have built around Rasa Open Source.

### Python Package Installation

The Rasa Pro python package is named `rasa-plus`. The `rasa-plus` python packages as well as the Docker containers are hosted on our GCP Artifact Registry.
As a prerequisite, you will need:

- to [install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
- to verify that the user or service account you are using has the required permissions to access the repository.

#### Authentication Set-Up

To authenticate you need use a service account key file provided by Rasa to authenticate with Google Cloud.

Authenticate with GCP using the service account key.

```sh
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=service-account.json
```

Set up keyring to allow Pip to authenticate with GCP Artifact Registry by installing keyring and then the backend that supports GCP Artifact Registry

```sh
pip install keyring
pip install keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth
```

Verify that the backends have been installed correctly

```sh
keyring --list-backends
```

The results should include `ChainerBackend` and `GooglePythonAuth`.


#### Installing with `pip`

Add these authentication settings to the `pip` configuration file. The location
for this depends on whether you want to update the per-user file or the file
specific to a virtual environment that you are using.

For the file associated with your operating system user:

- Linux: `$HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf` or `$HOME/.pip/pip.conf`
- MacOS: `/Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf` or `$HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini` or `%USERPROFILE%\pip\pip.ini`

For virtual environments:

- Linux and macOS: `$VIRTUAL_ENV/pip.conf`
- Windows: `%VIRTUAL_ENV%\pip.ini`

```
[global]
extra-index-url = https://europe-west3-python.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus-py/simple/
```

Finally, you should be able to run `pip install rasa-plus`.

#### Installing with `poetry`

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Poetry 1.4", "value": "poetry14"},{"label": "Poetry 1.6", "value": "poetry16"}]}
    groupId="poetry-versions" defaultValue="poetry16">
<TabItem value="poetry14">

To install `rasa-plus` with `poetry`, you will need to associate the Artifact Registry URL with `rasa-plus`
before installing it. Note that you must upgrade poetry to the latest minor version (currently `1.4.2`) in
order for `poetry` to work with the GCP authentication set-up.

1. Run `poetry self add "keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth"`
2. Add this section to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "rasa-plus"
url = "https://europe-west3-python.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus-py/simple"
default = false
secondary = true
```

3. Run `poetry install`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="poetry16">
To install `rasa-plus` with `poetry`, you will need to associate the Artifact
Registry URL with `rasa-plus` before installing it in order to authenticate
with GCP.

1. Run `poetry self add keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth`
2. Add this section to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "rasa-plus"
url = "https://europe-west3-python.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus-py/simple"
priority = "supplemental"
```

3. Run `poetry install`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Docker Image Installation

The Rasa Pro Docker image is named `rasa-plus`. The Docker images are hosted on our GCP Artifact Registry.
As a prerequisite, you will need:

- to [install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
- to verify that the user or service account you are using has the required permissions to access the repository.

To authenticate you need use a service account key file provided by Rasa to authenticate with Google Cloud.

```bash
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=${KEYFILE}
gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev
docker pull europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus/rasa-plus
```

### Using An Intermediate Repository
If you are using your own intermediate repository to cache libraries or dependencies (such as Artifactory or Nexus Repository Manager), you may need to generate a set of static credentials that allow you to authenticate with GCP Artifact Registry.

As a prerequisite, you will need:

- to [install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
- to verify that the user or service account you are using has the required permissions to access the repository.

To generate your credentials, run:

```sh
gcloud artifacts print-settings python \
    --project=rasa-releases \
    --repository=rasa-plus-py \
    --location=europe-west3 \
    --json-key=service-account.json
```

Your credentials can be found in the output. The username will be `_json_key_base64` and the password will be a long, base64 encoded string.

### Runtime Configuration

Rasa Pro will look for your license in the env var `RASA_PRO_LICENSE`.
You can set this env var temporarily in your terminal, but it is recommended
to set it persistently so that you don't have to set it every time you run
Rasa Pro.

Bash:

```sh
## Temporary
export RASA_PRO_LICENSE=<your-license-string>

## Persistent
echo "export RASA_PRO_LICENSE=<your-license-string>" >> ~/.bashrc
## If you're using a different flavor of bash e.g. Zsh, replace .bashrc with your shell's initialization script e.g. ~/.zshrc
```

Windows Powershell:

```powershell
## Temporary
$env: RASA_PRO_LICENSE=<your-license-string>

## Persistent
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('RASA_PRO_LICENSE','<your-license-string>')
```

Then you can use the [`rasa` CLI](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/command-line-interface) as usual, for example:

```sh
rasa init
```

:::note

If you run `rasa train` or `rasa run` after youâ€™ve enabled tracing using Jaeger as a backend in your local development environment,
you might come across this error `OSError: [Errno 40] Message too long`.

This could be caused by the OS of your local development environment restricting UDP packet size.
You can find out the current UDP packet size by running `sysctl net.inet.udp.maxdgram` on macOS.
You can increase UDP packet size by running `sudo sysctl -w net.inet.udp.maxdgram=65535`.
