In this section you will learn how to install **Rasa Plus**, a drop-in replacement enterprise-ready version of Rasa Open Source, on your development environment.

To learn more about deployments, please visit the following sections:

- [Deploying Rasa Plus in production](../../deploy/deploy-rasa)
- [Deploying Rasa Pro Services in production](../../deploy/deploy-rasa-pro-services)

To learn more about compatibility between different versions of  Rasa Plus and Rasa Pro Services, please see

## Rasa Plus Setup


Rasa Plus requires access credentials to install and a license to use. The instructions below assume you have
credentials and a license.

### Install for Development

Rasa Plus is a drop-in replacement and enterprise-ready version of Rasa Open Source.
Additional functionality is provided through plugins while allowing you to continue using the existing Rasa Open Source CLI commands and parameters as you used to.

Installing Rasa Plus instead of Rasa Open Source will not break any existing scripts, automation or functionality you have built around Rasa Open Source.

The `rasa-plus` python packages as well as the docker containers are hosted on our GCP artifact registry.
As a prerequisite, you will need:

- to [install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the Google Cloud CLI.
- to verify that the user or service account you are using has the required permissions to access the repository.

#### Authentication Set-Up

In order for the package manager of choice (e.g, `pip` or `poetry`) to have the necessary credentials to authenticate with the registry, follow the steps in the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/python/authentication#keyring).

Where required, input the following parameters:

```sh
gcloud artifacts print-settings python \
    --project=rasa-releases \
    --repository=rasa-plus-py \
    --location=europe-west3
```

#### Installing with `pip`

Enter the following settings to the `.pypirc` file:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    rasa-plus-py

[rasa-plus-py]
repository: https://europe-west3-python.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus-py/

```

Next, add these specific settings to the pip configuration file as instructed in the [GCP authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/python/authentication#keyring-setup):

```
[global]
extra-index-url = https://europe-west3-python.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus-py/simple/

```

Finally, you should be able to run `pip install rasa-plus`.

#### Installing with `poetry`

To install `rasa-plus` with `poetry`, you will need to associate the artifact registry URL with `rasa-plus` before installing it.
Note that you must upgrade poetry to the latest minor (`1.2.0`) in order for `poetry` to work with the GCP authentication set-up.
Proceed with the following steps:

1. Run `poetry self add "keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth"`
2. Add this section to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "rasa-plus"
url = "https://europe-west3-python.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus-py/simple"
default = false
secondary = true

```

3. Run `poetry install`.

#### Installing with Docker

To be able to pull the docker using `pull` you need to be authenticated first.

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev
docker pull europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-plus/rasa-plus
```

### Run Rasa Plus locally

Rasa Plus will look for your license in the env var `RASA_PRO_LICENSE`.
You can set this env var temporarily in your terminal, but it is recommended
to set it persistently so that you don't have to set it every time you run
Rasa Plus.

Bash:

```sh
## Temporary
export RASA_PRO_LICENSE=<your-license-string>

## Persistent
echo "export RASA_PRO_LICENSE=<your-license-string>" >> ~/.bashrc
## If you're using a different flavor of bash e.g. Zsh, replace .bashrc with your shell's initialization script e.g. ~/.zshrc
```

Windows Powershell:

```powershell
## Temporary
$env: RASA_PRO_LICENSE=<your-license-string>

## Persistent
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('RASA_PRO_LICENSE','<your-license-string>')
```

Then you can use the [`rasa` CLI](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/command-line-interface) as usual, for example:

```sh
rasa init
```

:::note

If you run `rasa train` or `rasa run` after you’ve enabled tracing using Jaeger as a backend in your local development environment,
you might come across this error `OSError: [Errno 40] Message too long`.

This could be caused by the OS of your local development environment restricting UDP packet size.
You can find out the current UDP packet size by running `sysctl net.inet.udp.maxdgram` on macOS.
You can increase UDP packet size by running `sudo sysctl -w net.inet.udp.maxdgram=65535`.
