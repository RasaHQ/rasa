id: domain
sidebar_label: Domain
title: Domain
abstract: The domain defines the universe in which your assistant operates. It specifies the intents, entities, slots, responses, forms, and actions your bot should know about. It also defines a configuration for conversation sessions.
---

Here is a full example of a domain, taken from the
[concertbot](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/tree/main/examples/concertbot) example:

```yaml-rasa (docs/sources/examples/concertbot/domain.yml)
```

## Multiple Domain Files

The domain can be defined as a single YAML file or split across multiple files in a directory.
When split across multiple files, the domain contents will be read and automatically merged together.

Using the [command line interface](./command-line-interface.mdx#rasa-train),
you can train a model with split domain files by running:

```bash
rasa train --domain path_to_domain_directory
```

## Intents

The `intents` key in your domain file lists all intents
used in your [NLU data](./nlu-training-data.mdx) and [conversation training data](./training-data-format.mdx#conversation-training-data).

### Ignoring Entities for Certain Intents

To ignore all entities for certain intents, you can
add the `use_entities: []` parameter to the intent in your domain
file like this:

```yaml-rasa
intents:
  - greet:
      use_entities: []
```

To ignore some entities or explicitly take only certain entities
into account you can use this syntax:

```yaml-rasa
intents:
- greet:
    use_entities:
      - name
      - first_name
- farewell:
    ignore_entities:
      - location
      - age
      - last_name
```

You can only `use_entities` _or_ `ignore_entities` for any single intent.

Excluded entities for those intents will be unfeaturized and therefore
will not impact the next action predictions. This is useful when you have
an intent where you don't care about the entities being picked up.

If you list your intents without a `use_entities` or `ignore_entities` 
parameter, the entities will be featurized as normal.


It is also possible to ignore an entity for all intents
by setting the `influence_conversation` flag to `false` for the entity itself.
See [the entities section](#entities) for details.

Excluded entities for intents will be unfeaturized and therefore
will not impact the next action predictions. This is useful when you have
an intent where you don't care about the entities being picked up.

If you list your intents without this parameter, and without setting 
`influence_conversation` to `false` for any entities, all entities will be
featurized as normal.

:::note
If you want these entities not to influence action prediction via slots either,
set the [`influence_conversation: false`](./domain.mdx#slots-and-conversation-behavior)
parameter for slots with the same name.

:::

## Entities
:::info New in 3.1

As of 3.1, you can use the `influence_conversation` flag under entities.
The flag can be set to `false` to declare that an entity should not
be featurized for any intents. It is a shorthand syntax for adding an entity to
the `ignore_entities` list of every intent in the domain. The flag is optional 
and default behavior remains unchanged.

:::

The `entities` section lists all entities that can be
extracted by any [entity extractor](./components.mdx) in your
NLU pipeline.

For example:

```yaml-rasa
entities:
   - PERSON           # entity extracted by SpacyEntityExtractor
   - time             # entity extracted by DucklingEntityExtractor
   - membership_type  # custom entity extracted by DIETClassifier
   - priority         # custom entity extracted by DIETClassifier
```

When using multiple domain files, entities can be specified in any domain file, 
and can be used or ignored by any intent in any domain file.

If you are using the feature [Entity Roles and Groups](./nlu-training-data.mdx#entities-roles-and-groups) you also
need to list the roles and groups of an entity in this section.

For example:

```yaml-rasa
entities:
   - city:            # custom entity extracted by DIETClassifier
       roles:
       - from
       - to
   - topping:         # custom entity extracted by DIETClassifier
       groups:
       - 1
       - 2
   - size:            # custom entity extracted by DIETClassifier
       groups:
       - 1
       - 2
```

By default, entities influence action prediction. To prevent extracted entities from
influencing the conversation for specific intents you can [ignore entities for certain intents](#ignoring-entities-for-certain-intents).
To ignore an entity for all intents, without having to list it under the `ignore_entities` flag of each intent, 
you can set the flag `influence_conversation` to `false` under the entity:

```yaml-rasa
entities:
- location:
    influence_conversation: false
```
This syntax has the same effect as adding the entity to the `ignore_entities` 
list for every intent in the domain.

Explicitly setting `influence_conversation: true` does not change any behavior. This is the default setting.

## Slots

Slots are your bot's memory. They act as a key-value store
which can be used to store information the user provided (e.g their home city)
as well as information gathered about the outside world (e.g. the result of a
database query).

Slots are defined in the slots section of your domain with their name,
[type](domain.mdx#slot-types) and if and how they should [influence the assistant's
behavior](domain.mdx#slots-and-conversation-behavior).
The following example defines a slot with name "slot_name", type `text` and
predefined slot mapping `from_entity`.

```yaml
slots:
  slot_name:
    type: text
    mappings:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: entity_name
```

### Slots and Conversation Behavior

You can specify whether or not a slot influences the conversation with the
`influence_conversation` property. 

If you want to store information in a slot without it influencing the conversation,
set `influence_conversation: false` when defining your slot. 

The following example defines a slot `age` which will store information about the
user's age, but which will *not* influence the flow of the conversation. This means
that the assistant will ignore the value of the slot each time it predicts the next action.

```yaml
slots:
  age:
    type: text
    # this slot will not influence the predictions
    # of the dialogue policies
    influence_conversation: false
```

When defining a slot, if you leave out `influence_conversation` or set it to `true`,
that slot will influence the next action prediction, unless it has slot type `any`.
The way the slot influences the conversation
will depend on its [slot type](./domain.mdx#slot-types).

The following example defines a slot `home_city` that influences the conversation. 
A [`text` slot](domain.mdx#text-slot) will
influence the assistant's behavior depending on whether the slot has a value.
The specific value of a `text` slot (e.g. *Bangalore* or *New York* or *Hong Kong*)
doesn't make any difference. 

```yaml
slots:
  # this slot will influence the conversation depending on
  # whether the slot is set or not
  home_city:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: true
```

As an example, consider the two inputs "What is the weather like?" and "What is the
weather like in Bangalore?" The conversation should diverge based on whether
the `home_city` slot was set automatically by the NLU. If the slot is already set, the bot
can predict the `action_forecast` action. If the slot is not set, it needs to get the `home_city`
information before it is able to predict the weather.

### Slot Types


#### Text Slot

* **Type**

  `text`

* **Use For**

  Storing text values.

* **Example**

  ```yaml-rasa
  slots:
     cuisine:
        type: text
        mappings:
        - type: from_entity
          entity: cuisine
  ```

* **Description**

  If `influence_conversation` is set to `true`, the assistant's behavior will change
  depending on whether the slot is set or not. Different texts do not influence the
  conversation any further. This means the following two stories are equal:

  ```yaml-rasa
  stories:
  - story: French cuisine
    steps:
    - intent: inform
    - slot_was_set:
      - cuisine: french

  - story: Vietnamese cuisine
    steps:
    - intent: inform
    - slot_was_set:
      - cuisine: vietnamese
  ```

#### Boolean Slot

* **Type**

  `bool`

* **Use For**

  Storing `true` or `false` values.

* **Example**

  ```yaml-rasa
  slots:
     is_authenticated:
        type: bool
        mappings:
        - type: custom
  ```

* **Description**

  If `influence_conversation` is set to `true`, the assistant's behavior will change
  depending on whether the slot is empty, set to `true` or set to `false`. Note that an
  empty `bool` slot influences the conversation differently than if the slot was set to
  `false`.

#### Categorical Slot

* **Type**

  `categorical`

* **Use For**

  Storing slots which can take one of N values.

* **Example**

  ```yaml-rasa
  slots:
    risk_level:
      type: categorical
      values:
        - low
        - medium
        - high
      mappings:
      - type: custom
  ```

* **Description**

  If `influence_conversation` is set to `true`, the assistant's behavior will change
  depending on the concrete value of the slot. This means the assistant's behavior is
  different depending on whether the slot in the above example has the value `low`,
  `medium`, or `high`.

  A default value `__other__` is automatically added to the user-defined
  values. All values encountered which are not explicitly defined in the slot's `values`
  are mapped to `__other__`.
  `__other__` should not be used as a user-defined value; if it is, it
  will still behave as the default to which all unseen values are mapped.

#### Float Slot

* **Type**

  `float`

* **Use For**

  Storing real numbers.

* **Example**

  ```yaml-rasa
  slots:
    temperature:
      type: float
      min_value: -100.0
      max_value:  100.0
      mappings:
      - type: custom
  ```

* **Defaults**

  `max_value=1.0`, `min_value=0.0`

* **Description**

  If `influence_conversation` is set to `true`, the assistant's behavior will change
  depending on the value of the slot. If the value is between `min_value` and
  `max_value`, the specific value of the number is used.
  All values below `min_value` will be treated as `min_value`, and all values above
  `max_value` will be treated as `max_value`. Hence, if `max_value` is set to `1`,
  there is no difference between the slot values `2` and `3.5`.

#### List Slot

* **Type**

  `list`

* **Use For**

  Storing lists of values.

* **Example**

  ```yaml-rasa
  slots:
    shopping_items:
      type: list
      mappings:
      - type: from_entity
        entity: shopping_item
  ```

* **Description**

  If `influence_conversation` is set to `true`, the assistant's behavior will change
  depending on whether the list is empty or not. The length of the list stored in
  the slot does not influence the dialogue. It only matters whether list length is zero or non-zero.

#### Any Slot

* **Type**

  `any`

* **Use For**

  Storing arbitrary values (they can be of any type, such as dictionaries or lists).

* **Example**

  ```yaml-rasa
  slots:
    shopping_items:
      type: any
      mappings:
      - type: custom
  ```

* **Description**

  Slots of type `any` are always ignored during conversations. The property
  `influence_conversation` cannot be set to `true` for this slot type. If you want to
  store a custom data structure which should influence the conversation, use a
  [custom slot type](domain.mdx#custom-slot-types).

#### Custom Slot Types

Maybe your restaurant booking system can only handle bookings
for up to 6 people. In this case you want the *value* of the
slot to influence the next selected action (and not just whether
it's been specified). You can do this by defining a custom slot class.

The code below defines a custom slot class called `NumberOfPeopleSlot`. 
The featurization defines how the value of this slot gets converted to a vector
so Rasa machine learning model can deal with it.
The `NumberOfPeopleSlot` has three possible “values”, which can be represented with
a vector of length `2`.

|        |                |
|--------|----------------|
|`(0,0)` |not yet set     |
|`(1,0)` |between 1 and 6 |
|`(0,1)` |more than 6     |

```python title="my_custom_slots.py"
from rasa.shared.core.slots import Slot

class NumberOfPeopleSlot(Slot):

    def feature_dimensionality(self):
        return 2

    def as_feature(self):
        r = [0.0] * self.feature_dimensionality()
        if self.value:
            if self.value <= 6:
                r[0] = 1.0
            else:
                r[1] = 1.0
        return r
```

You can implement a custom slot class as an independent python module, 
separate from custom action code. Save the code for your custom slot in a directory 
alongside an empty file called "\_\_init\_\_.py" so that it will be recognized as a python module.
You can then refer to the custom slot class by it's module path.

For example, say you have saved the code above in "addons/my_custom_slots.py", a directory relative to your bot project:

```bash
└── rasa_bot
    ├── addons
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── my_custom_slots.py
    ├── config.yml
    ├── credentials.yml
    ├── data
    ├── domain.yml
    ├── endpoints.yml
```

Your custom slot type's module path
is then `addons.my_custom_slots.NumberOfPeopleSlot`.
Use the module path to refer to the custom slot type in your domain file:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yaml"
slots:
  people:
    type: addons.my_custom_slots.NumberOfPeopleSlot
    influence_conversation: true
    mappings:
    - type: custom
```

Now that your custom slot class can be used by Rasa, add training stories that diverge based on the value of the `people` slot.
You could write one story for the case where `people` has a value between 1 and 6, and one for a value greater than six. You can choose any value within these ranges to put in your stories, since they are all featurized the same way (see the featurization table above).


```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: collecting table info
  steps:
  # ... other story steps
  - intent: inform
    entities:
    - people: 3
  - slot_was_set:
    - people: 3
  - action: action_book_table

- story: too many people at the table
  steps:
  # ... other story steps
  - intent: inform
    entities:
    - people: 9
  - slot_was_set:
    - people: 9
  - action: action_explain_table_limit
```

### Slot Mappings

:::info New in 3.0

As of 3.0, slot mappings are defined in the `slots` section of the domain.
This change removes the implicit mechanism of setting slots via auto-fill and replaces it with a new explicit
mechanism of setting slots after every user message.
You will need to explicitly define slot mappings for each slot in the `slots` section of `domain.yml`.
If you are migrating from an earlier version, please read through the [migration guide](./migration-guide.mdx#slot-mappings)
to update your assistant.

:::

Rasa comes with four predefined mappings to fill slots
based on the latest user message.

In addition to the predefined mappings, you can define [custom slot mappings](./domain.mdx#custom-slot-mappings).
All custom slot mappings should contain a mapping of type `custom`.

Slot mappings are specified as a YAML list of dictionaries under the key `mappings` in the domain file.
Slot mappings are prioritized in the order they are listed in the domain. The first slot mapping found to apply will be used to fill the slot.

The default behavior is for slot mappings to apply after every user message, regardless of the dialogue context.
To make a slot mapping apply only within the context of a form see [Mapping Conditions](./domain.mdx#mapping-conditions).
There is one additional default limitation on applying `from_entity` slot mappings in the context of a form;
see [unique `from_entity` mapping matching](./domain.mdx#unique-from_entity-mapping-matching) for details.

Note that you can also define lists of intents for the optional parameters `intent` and `not_intent`.

#### from_entity

The `from_entity` slot mapping fills slots based on extracted entities.
The following parameters are required:
- `entity`: the entity that should fill the slot

The following parameters are optional and can be used to further specify when the mapping applies:
- `intent`: Only applies the mapping when this intent is predicted.
- `not_intent`: Does not apply the mapping when this intent is predicted
- `role`: Only applies the mapping if the extracted entity has this role
- `group`: Only applies the mapping if the extracted entity belongs to this group.

```yaml-rasa
entities:
- entity_name
slots:
  slot_name:
    type: any
    mappings:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: entity_name
      role: role_name
      group: group name
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

##### Unique `from_entity` mapping matching

There is an intentional limitation on applying `from_entity` slot mappings in the context of a form.
When a form is active, a `from_entity` slot mapping will be applied only if one or more of the following conditions are met:

1. The slot with the `from_entity` mapping has just been requested by the form
2. Only one of the active form's `required_slots` has that specific `from_entity` mapping,
including all the attributes of the extracted entity (i.e, entity name, role, group). This is known as a **unique entity mapping** for the form. 
The extracted entity will be ignored if the mapping is not unique within the list of `required_slots`.

This limitation exists to prevent a form from filling multiple required slots with the same extracted entity value.

For example, in the example below, an entity `date` uniquely sets the slot `arrival_date`,
an entity `city` with a role `from` uniquely sets the slot `departure_city` and
an entity `city` with a role `to` uniquely sets the slot `arrival_city`,
therefore they can be used to fit corresponding slots
even if these slots were not requested.
However, entity `city` without a role can fill both `departure_city` and `arrival_city`
slots, depending which one is requested, so if an entity `city` is extracted when
slot `arrival_date` is requested, it'll be ignored by the form.

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  departure_city:
    type: text
    mappings:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: city
      role: from
    - type: from_entity
      entity: city
  arrival_city:
    type: text
    mappings:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: city
      role: to
    - type: from_entity
      entity: city
  arrival_date:
    type: any
    mappings:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: date
forms:
  your_form:
    required_slots:
    - departure_city
    - arrival_city
    - arrival_date
```

Note that the unique `from_entity` mapping constraint will **not** prevent filling slots which are not in the active form's `required_slots`;
those mappings will apply as usual, regardless of the uniqueness of the mapping. To limit applicability of a slot mapping to
a specific form, see [Mapping Conditions](./domain.mdx#mapping-conditions).

#### from_text

The `from_text` mapping will use the text of the last user utterance to fill the slot
`slot_name`. If `intent_name` is `None`, the slot will be filled regardless of intent name.
Otherwise, the slot will only be filled if the user's intent is `intent_name`.

The slot mapping will not apply if the intent of the message is `excluded_intent`.

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  slot_name:
    type: text
    mappings:
    - type: from_text
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

:::note
To maintain the 2.x form behavior when using `from_text` slot mappings, you must use [mapping conditions](./domain.mdx#mapping-conditions),
where both `active_loop` and `requested_slot` keys are defined.
:::


#### from_intent

The `from_intent` mapping will fill slot `slot_name` with value `my_value` if
user intent is `intent_name`. If you choose not to specify the parameter `intent`,
the slot mapping will apply regardless of the intent of the message as long as
the intent is not listed under `not_intent` parameter.

The following parameter is required:
- `value`: the value that fills the slot `slot_name`

The following parameters are optional and can be used to further specify when the mapping applies:
- `intent`: Only applies the mapping when this intent is predicted.
- `not_intent`: Does not apply the mapping when this intent is predicted

Note that if you choose not to define the parameter `intent`, the slot mapping will apply regardless of the intent
of the message as long as the intent is not listed under the `not_intent` parameter.

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  slot_name:
    type: any
    mappings:
    - type: from_intent
      value: my_value
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

#### from_trigger_intent

The `from_trigger_intent` mapping will fill slot `slot_name` with value `my_value`
if a form is activated by a user message with intent `intent_name`.
The slot mapping will not apply if the intent of the message is
`excluded_intent`.

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  slot_name:
    type: any
    mappings:
    - type: from_trigger_intent
      value: my_value
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

### Mapping Conditions

To apply a slot mapping only within the context of a form, specify
the name of the form in the `conditions` key of a slot mapping. Conditions list the form name(s)
for which the mapping is applicable in the `active_loop` key.

:::info New in 3.6
Slot mappings can now specify `null` as the value of `active_loop` to indicate that the slot should only be filled when
no form is active. Note that `requested_slot` cannot be used in conjunction with `active_loop: null`.
:::

Conditions can also include the name of the `requested_slot`. If `requested_slot` is not mentioned,
then the slot will be set if relevant information is extracted, regardless of which slot is being
requested by the form.

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  slot_name:
    type: text
    mappings:
    - type: from_text
      intent: intent_name
      conditions:
      - active_loop: your_form
        requested_slot: slot_name
      - active_loop: another_form
```

:::note
If `conditions` are not included in a slot mapping, the slot mapping will be applicable regardless of whether
any form is active. As long as a slot is listed in a form's `required_slots`, the form will prompt for the slot
if it is empty when the form is activated.
:::

### Custom Slot Mappings

You can define custom slot mappings using [slot validation actions](./slot-validation-actions.mdx) when none of the
predefined mappings fit your use case. You must define this slot mapping to be of type `custom`, for example:

```yaml
slots:
  day_of_week:
    type: text
    mappings:
    - type: custom
      action: action_calculate_day_of_week
```

You can also use the `custom` slot mapping to list slots that will be filled by arbitrary custom actions in the course
of a conversation, by listing the type and no specific action. For example:

```yaml
slots:
  handoff_completed:
    type: boolean
    mappings:
    - type: custom
```

This slot will not be updated on every user turn, but only once a custom action that returns a `SlotSet` event for it is predicted.

### Initial slot values

You can provide an initial value for a slot in your domain file:

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  num_fallbacks:
    type: float
    initial_value: 0
    mappings:
    - type: custom
```

## Responses

Responses are actions that send a message to a user without running any custom code or
returning events. These responses can be defined directly in the domain file under the `responses` key
and can include rich content such as buttons and attachments. For more information on responses and how to define them,
see [Responses](./responses.mdx).


## Forms

Forms are a special type of action meant to help your assistant collect information from a user.
Define forms under the `forms` key in your domain file.
For more information on form and how to define them, see [Forms](./forms.mdx).


## Actions

[Actions](./actions.mdx) are the things your bot can actually do.
For example, an action could:

* respond to a user,

* make an external API call,

* query a database, or

* just about anything!

All [custom actions](./custom-actions.mdx) should be listed in your domain, except responses which need not be listed
under `actions:` as they are already listed under `responses:`.

### Select which actions should receive domain
:::info New in 3.4.3
You can control if an action should receive a domain or not.
:::

To do this you must first enable selective domain in you endpoint configuration for
`action_endpoint` in `endpoints.yml`.
```YAML
# endpoints.yml
action_endpoint:
 url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook" # URL to your action server
 enable_selective_domain: true
```
**After selective domain for custom actions is enabled, domain will be sent only to
those custom actions which have specifically stated that they need it.**
Custom actions inheriting from rasa-sdk [`FormValidationAction`](./action-server/validation-action.mdx#formvalidationaction-class)
parent class are an exception to this rule as they will always have the domain sent to them.
To specify if an action needs the domain add `{send_domain: true}` to custom action in the list
of actions in `domain.yml`:
```YAML
# domain.yml
actions:
  - action_hello_world: {send_domain: True} # will receive domain
  - action_calculate_mass_of_sun # will not receive domain
  - validate_my_form # will receive domain
```


## Session configuration

A conversation session represents the dialogue between the assistant and the user.
Conversation sessions can begin in three ways:

1. the user begins the conversation with the assistant,

2. the user sends their first message after a configurable period of inactivity, or

3. a manual session start is triggered with the `/session_start` intent message.

You can define the period of inactivity after which a new conversation
session is triggered in the domain under the `session_config` key.

Available parameters are:
- `session_expiration_time` defines the time of inactivity in minutes after which a
new session will begin.
- `carry_over_slots_to_new_session` determines whether
existing set slots should be carried over to new sessions.

The default session configuration looks as follows:

```yaml-rasa
session_config:
  session_expiration_time: 60  # value in minutes, 0 means infinitely long
  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true  # set to false to forget slots between sessions
```

This means that if a user sends their first message after 60 minutes of inactivity, a
new conversation session is triggered, and that any existing slots are carried over
into the new session. Setting the value of `session_expiration_time` to `0` means
that sessions will not end (note that the `action_session_start` action will still
be triggered at the very beginning of conversations).

:::note
A session start triggers the default action `action_session_start`. Its default
implementation moves all existing slots into the new session. Note that all
conversations begin with an `action_session_start`. Overriding this action could
for instance be used to initialize the tracker with slots from an external API
call, or to start the conversation with a bot message. The docs on
[Customizing the session start action](./default-actions.mdx#customization) shows you how to do that.

## Config

The `config` key in the domain file maintains the `store_entities_as_slots` parameter.
This parameter is used only in the context of reading stories and turning them into trackers. If the parameter is set
to `True`, this will result in slots being implicitly set from entities if applicable entities are present in the story.
When an entity matches the `from_entity` slot mapping, `store_entities_as_slots` defines whether the entity value should
be placed in that slot. Therefore, this parameter skips adding an explicit `slot_was_set` step manually in the story.
By default, this behavior is switched on.

You can turn off this functionality by setting the `store_entities_as_slots` parameter to `false`:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
config:
  store_entities_as_slots: false
```
