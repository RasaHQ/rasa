Get started with Rasa Open Source and learn how to create an assistant from scratch!

This page explains the basics of building an assistant with Rasa Open Source and shows the structure of a Rasa project.
You can test it out right here without installing anything. You can also install
[install Rasa Open Source](./installation.mdx) and follow along in your command line.

## 1. Define a basic user goal

To prototype an assistant, start with a single [user goal](./glossary.mdx#user-goal)
that your assistant will handle. You can create a prototype with the "subscribing to a newsletter" user goal
we have chosen, or you can come up with your own. If you choose your own user goal,
you can create a prototype that handles your goal by following the instructions to change each
section throughout the tutorial.


## 2. Create some NLU data

[NLU](./glossary.mdx#rasa-nlu) data provides examples of what users might say to your assistant and what they mean by it.
[Intent](./glossary.mdx#intent)  refers to what the user means with a specific message.
Your assistant can only learn to recognize intents for which it has seen examples, so we need to provide some data.

Add examples for your user-goal specific intents in the format shown below.
You can delete the `subscribe` and `inform` intents if you're not using them;
you can also add or change examples for any of the other intents.

```yaml-rasa live noResult name=nlu
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
    - Hi
    - Hey!
    - Hallo
    - Good day
    - Good morning

- intent: subscribe
  examples: |
    - I want to get the newsletter
    - Can you send me the newsletter?
    - Can you sign me up for the newsletter?

- intent: inform
  examples: |
    - My email is example@example.com
    - random@example.com
    - Please send it to anything@example.com
    - Email is something@example.com
```

## 3. Define a simple form

For most user goals, the bot will need to collect some information from the user to fulfill their request.
To do so, we define a [form](./glossary.mdx#form). You can change the name of the form to reflect your user goal.
Add to or replace the `email` item in the list below to reflect the information the bot needs
to collect for your user goal. Leave the `type` field the same for any items you add.

```yaml-rasa live noResult name=forms
forms:
- newsletter_form:
    email:
    - type: from_text
```

## 4. Write a rule

Rules are conversation snippets that should always proceed in exactly the same way.
Update the rule below for running the form you defined above.

```yaml-rasa live noResult name=rules
rules:
 - rule: activate subscribe form
   steps:
   - intent: subscribe
   - action: newsletter_form
   - active_loop: newsletter_form
```

## 5. Write some stories

Stories are example conversations of how your assistant should handle a user's intent in context.
The first stories you write should follow the [happy path](./glossary.mdx#happy--unhappy-paths) for your user goal.

A story contains one or more blocks of (user) intent and (bot) [actions](./glossary.mdx#action) or [responses](./glossary.mdx#template--response--utterance).
The form you defined above is one kind of action; responses are just bot messages.
Give intuitive names to your responses starting with `utter_` for now; you'll define what they return later.

Using the general template of the story we have shown you below, write a story or two that serve
the user goal you have chosen. You can include the steps from your form rule wherever appropriate.

```yaml-rasa live noResult name=stories
stories:
 - story: greet and subscribe
   steps:
   - intent: greet
   - action: utter_greet
   - intent: subscribe
   - action: newsletter_form
   - active_loop: newsletter_form
```

## 6. Edit responses

To give your bot messages to respond to the user with, you need to define responses.
You can specify one or more text options for each response. If there are multiple, one of the options
will be chosen at random whenever that response is predicted.

You can add or change text for any of the responses below. If you're using your own user goal,
replace the last three responses with the response you used in your stories above.

```yaml-rasa live noResult name=responses
responses:
   utter_greet:
       - text: |
           Hello! How can I help you?
       - text: |
           Hi!
   utter_ask_email:
       - text: |
           What is your email address?
   utter_subscribed:
       - text: |
           I've subscribed {email} to the newsletter!
       - text: |
           You've been subscribed, the newsletter will be sent to {email}.
```

:::note
For this prototype, we have only defined responses, meaning the only thing the assistant does is respond with a
predefined message. Custom actions, however, can be defined to do whatever you'd like.
For example, for the user goal of subscribing to a newsletter, you could create a custom action
that adds the user's email to a database. You can see an example of this
in [Sara's action code](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/actions/actions.py).

## 7. Train and run

Rasa has a command line interface that allows you to train and run your bot from a terminal.
To train your bot on the NLU data, stories and responses you've just defined, run `rasa train` using
the button below:

<TrainButton />

Once your model has finished training, you can talk to your assistant:

<div id="rasa-chat-block"></div>


## 8. What's next?

You can download this project and build on it to create a more advanced assistant.
In your downloaded project, you'll notice several files that were configured for you that you didn't edit on this page.
Check out other docs pages to learn more about [domains](./domain.mdx), [actions](./actions.mdx),
and your [model configuration](./model-configuration.mdx).

<!-- TODO: REMOVE THIS NOTE FOR THE 2.0 release -->

*Your prototype was created using a Rasa Open Source alpha release.
Please make sure you've [installed at least Rasa Open Source 2.0.0a2](installation.mdx) to develop
your project further.*
