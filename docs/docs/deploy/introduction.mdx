## When to Deploy Your Assistant

The best time to deploy your assistant and make it available to test users is once it can handle the most
important happy paths or is what we call a [minimum viable assistant](./glossary.mdx).

The recommended deployment method described in the Deploy Your Assistant section make it easy to share your assistant
with test users via the [share your assistant feature in
Rasa X](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/share-assistant#share-your-bot).
Then, when you're ready to make your assistant available via one or more [Messaging and Voice Channels](./messaging-and-voice-channels.mdx),
you can easily add them to your existing deployment set up.

## Recommended Deployment Method

The [Rasa Open Source Helm chart](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa) is the supported method to deploy
your assistant. It can also allows you to connect Rasa OSS with a separate Rasa X or
Rasa Enterprise deployment and is production ready. See the [Alternative Deployment Methods](./deploy-rasa#alternative-deployment-methods)
for details on building your bot locally, with Docker, Rasa Ephemeral Installer, or deploying with docker-compose.

For more details on Rasa X deployment methods see the [Rasa X Installation Guide](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/installation-guide/).

The following instructions describe how to deploy a Rasa Open Source server
by using the [Rasa Helm Chart](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rasa) in a scalable cluster environment using OpenShift or Kubernetes (K8S).

### Cluster Requirements

To install the Rasa Helm chart, you need an existing
[Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/) or [OpenShift cluster](https://www.openshift.com/).
Setting up a Kubernetes / OpenShift cluster can be tedious, hence we
recommend to get a managed cluster from a cloud provider like
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine),
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/),
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), or
[Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

:::note
The Rasa Helm chart is open source and available in the
[helm-charts repository](https://github.com/rasahq/helm-charts).
Please
[create an issue](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/issues/new) in this
repository if you discover bugs or have suggestions for improvements.
