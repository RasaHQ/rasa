## [2.4.1] - 2021-03-23

### Bugfixes

- [#419](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/419): Missing `typing_extensions` module added

  Minor dependency updates

- [#8223](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/8223): `utter_message` in `CollectingDispatcher` now explicitly takes in both `response` and `template`. Note that the parameter `template` will be deprecated in Rasa SDK 3.0.0. Please use `dispatcher.utter_message(response=...)` instead.

## [2.4.0] - 2021-03-11

### Bugfixes

- [#406](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/406): Fix bug where ActionQueryKnowledgeBase incorrectly issues a template message with the string representation of the function for getting the string representation of the knowledge base item and not the actual string representation of the knowledge base item.

  For example, before the fix, the query knowledge base demo bot would utter this

  ```
  '<function ActionMyKB.init.. at 0x7fb23b7fddd0>' has the value 'True' for attribute 'breakfast-included'.
  ```

  instead of this:

  ```
  'Hilton (Berlin)' has the value 'True' for attribute 'breakfast-included'.
  ```

## [2.3.1] - 2021-02-11

### Bugfixes

- [#404](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/1234): Only pin the `uvloop` dependency for non-Windows systems as `uvloop` is not available
  for Windows.

### Features

- [#306](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/306): Added command line argument option `--log-file` for the action server to save logs to a log file.

  Usage :
  `rasa run actions --log-file log_file.log`

## [2.2.0] - 2020-12-15

No significant changes.

## [2.1.2] - 2020-11-19

No significant changes.

## [2.1.1] - 2020-11-17

### Bugfixes

- [#344](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/344): Fix a bug in the `FormValidationAction` which immediately deactivated the form.

## [2.1.0] - 2020-11-17

### Features

- [#329](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/329): Extend `FormValidationAction` with support for extracting slots. If you
  want to extract an additional slot, add the slot's name to the list of `required_slots`
  and add a method `extract_<slot name>` to your action:

```python
  from typing import Text, Dict, Any, List, Optional

  from rasa_sdk.forms import (
      FormValidationAction,
  )

  class FormWithSlotExtractions(FormValidationAction):
      def name(self) -> Text:
          return "some_form"

      async def required_slots(
          self,
          slots_mapped_in_domain: List[Text],
          dispatcher: "CollectingDispatcher",
          tracker: "Tracker",
          domain: "DomainDict",
      ) -> Optional[List[Text]]:
          return slots_mapped_in_domain + ["my_slot"]

      async def extract_my_slot(
          self,
          dispatcher: "CollectingDispatcher",
          tracker: "Tracker",
          domain: "DomainDict",
      ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
          return {"my_slot": "some value"}
```

If all slots returned by `required_slots` are filled,
the action will automatically return an event to disable the form.
If not all required slots are filled, the SDK will return an event
to Rasa Open Source to fill the first missing slot next.

### Improvements

- [#7078](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/7078): Adds the method `get_intent_of_latest_message` to the `Tracker` allowing easier
  access to the user's latest intent in case of an `nlu_fallback`.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-10-07

### Deprecations and Removals

- [#246](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/246): Using the `Form` event is
  deprecated. Please use the new `ActiveLoop` event instead.
  Using the `active_form` property of the `Tracker` object is now deprecated. Please
  use the `active_loop` property instead.

  The usage of the `FormAction` is deprecated. Please see the migration guide
  for Rasa Open Source 2.0 for instructions how to migrate your `FormAction`s.

- [#250](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/250): Removed support for the
  `rasa_core_sdk` python module: use `import rasa_sdk` syntax instead.
- [#6463](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/6463): The `FormValidation` event
  was renamed to `LoopInterrupted` as part of Rasa Open Source 2.0. Using the
  `FormValidation` is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  Please use `LoopInterrupted` instead.

### Features

- [#238](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/238): Added the method
  `slots_to_validate` to `Tracker`. This method is helpful
  when using a custom action to validate slots which were extracted by a
  form as shown by the following example.

  ```python
  from typing import Text, Dict, List, Any
  from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
  from rasa_sdk.events import EventType, SlotSet
  from rasa_sdk.types import DomainDict
  from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

  class ValidateSlots(Action):
      def name(self) -> Text:
          return "validate_your_form"

      def run(
          self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: DomainDict
      ) -> List[EventType]:
          extracted_slots: Dict[Text, Any] = tracker.slots_to_validate()

          validation_events = []

          for slot_name, slot_value in extracted_slots.items():
              # Check if slot is valid.
              if self.is_valid(slot_value):
                  validation_events.append(SlotSet(slot_name, slot_value))
              else:
                  # Return a `SlotSet` event with value `None` to indicate that this
                  # slot still needs to be filled.
                  validation_events.append(SlotSet(slot_name, None))

          return validation_events

      def is_valid(self, slot_value: Any) -> bool:
          # Implementation of the validate function.
        return True
  ```

  Please note that `tracker.form_slots_to_validate` only works with Rasa Open Source 2.

### Improvements

- [#239](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/239): Validate user input during
  form activation even if there is an action in between.
- [#246](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/246): Rasa Open Source 2.0 renamed
  the `Form` event to `ActiveLoop`. The `ActiveLoop`
  event was added to the SDK and support for the `active_loop` field in JSON payloads
  was added.
- [#267](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/267): The `actions` package
  in a Rasa project may contain multiple files containing custom
  action code. The Rasa SDK Docker container now loads the entire `actions` package.
- [#288](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/288): Add the `FormValidationAction`
  abstract class that can be used to validate slots which were extracted by a Form.

  Example:

```python
  from typing import Text, Any, Dict
  from rasa_sdk import FormValidationAction, Tracker
  from rasa_sdk.types import DomainDict
  from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

  class MyFormValidationAction(FormValidationAction):
      def name(self) -> Text:
          return "some_form"

      def validate_slot1(
          self,
          slot_value: Any,
          dispatcher: "CollectingDispatcher",
          tracker: "Tracker",
          domain: "DomainDict",
      ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
          if slot_value == "correct_value":
              return {
                  "slot1": "validated_value",
              }
          return {
              "slot1": None,
          }
```

- [#6463](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/6463): Added support for the
  `LoopInterrupted` event.

### Bugfixes

- [#280](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/280): `tracker.applied_events`
  now correctly deals with restart, undo, and rewind events

### Miscellaneous internal changes

- [#265](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/265)

## [1.10.3] - 2020-09-23

### Bugfixes

- [#273](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk/pull/273): Only fill other slots if slot mapping contains a role or group restriction and the entity type matches.

## [1.10.2] - 2020-06-25

### Bugfixes

- [#220](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk/pull/220): Re-added an `Action endpoint is up and running` log that was removed in Rasa SDK 1.6.0.

## [1.10.1] - 2020-05-11

### Bugfixes

- [#212](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/212): Fix `ActionExecutor` sometimes not loading user-defined actions that inherit from other user-defined ones.

## [1.10.0] - 2020-04-28

### Features

- [#164](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk/pull/164): Added new `--auto-reload` CLI argument. When specified, modules containing `Action`
  subclasses will be automatically reloaded if they have been modified since the last HTTP
  request. By using this, one can avoid having to re-start the actions server when
  developing new actions.

- [#3765](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/3765): Add support for entities with role and group labels.

  If you use `from_entity` in your custom slot mapping, you can now also specify a role and group label.
  If you set a role or group label, the slot is only filled if the entity has the specific role or group label set.
  If you don’t specify a role or group label, the function behaves as before.

### Improvements

- [#176](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/176): The Rasa SDK image now uses Python 3.7 instead of Python 3.6.

### Bugfixes

- [#176](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/176): Updated `pyyaml` dependency to `5.3.1` to fix
  [CVE-2020-1747](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1747)

## [1.9.0] - 2020-03-24

### Bugfixes

- [#110](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/110): Exit program (`python -m rasa_sdk --actions actions` or
  `rasa run actions --actions actions`) if a requested module under the
  `--actions` command-line option cannot be found.

## [1.8.1] - 2020-03-09

### Bugfixes

- [#153](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/153): Make it possible to use the `requests` library inside the default Rasa SDK container.

## [1.8.0] - 2020-02-26

### Improvements

- [#130](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/130): Copied over instance methods `last_executed_action_has()`, `get_last_event_for()` and
  `applied_events` from the Rasa `DialogueStateTracker` class to the SDK `Tracker` class.

- [#145](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa-sdk/issues/145): Add `poetry` for dependency management and reduce the size of Docker image.

### Miscellaneous internal changes

- #148, #149

## [1.7.0] - 2020-01-29

### Improvements

- `ReminderScheduled` and `ReminderCancelled` now take `intent` and `entities`
  as options, instead of `action`. This is because starting with Rasa 1.7 reminders
  trigger intents (with entities) instead of actions.

- The following `FormAction` methods are now `async` by default: `validate_slots`,
  `validate`, `submit` and `run`. User-defined classes inheriting from
  `FormAction` should be adapted to use `async` for these methods. Existing
  synchronous implementations will continue to work as normal, but this behaviour will
  be deprecated in the future.

- The following `ActionQueryKnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
  `utter_objects` and `run`.

- The following `KnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
  `get_attributes_of_object`, `get_key_attribute_of_object`,
  `get_representation_function_of_object`, `get_objects` and `get_object`. Same
  warning for `FormAction` applies here - user-defined classes should be updated to
  use `async`, but will continue to work for the moment.

- The following `InMemoryKnowledgeBase` methods are now `async`:
  `get_attributes_of_object`, `get_objects` and `get_object`.

### Improvements

- Replace `flask` server framework with `sanic`.

- Replace `flask_cors` with `sanic-cors`.

- `CollectingDispatcher.utter_message` can now do anything that other dispatcher
  methods can do.

- The `CollectingDispatcher` methods `utter_custom_message`, `utter_elements`,
  `utter_button_message`, `utter_attachment`, `utter_button_template`,
  `utter_template`, `utter_custom_json` and `utter_image_url` were deprecated in
  favor of `utter_message`.

- Updated format strings to f-strings where appropriate.
