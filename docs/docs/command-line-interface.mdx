:::note
If you run into character encoding issues on Windows like: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character ...` or
the terminal is not displaying colored messages properly, prepend `winpty` to the command you would like to run.
For example `winpty rasa init` instead of `rasa init`
:::

## Log Level

Rasa produces log messages at several different levels (eg. warning, info, error and so on). You can control which level of logs you would like to see with `--verbose` (same as `-v`) or `--debug` (same as `-vv`) as optional command line arguments. See each command below for more explanation on what these arguments mean.

In addition to CLI arguments, several environment variables allow you to control log output in a more granular way. With these environment variables, you can configure log levels for messages created by external libraries such as Matplotlib, Pika, and Kafka. These variables follow [standard logging level in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels). Currently, following environment variables are supported:

1. LOG_LEVEL_LIBRARIES: This is the general environment variable to configure log level for the main libraries Rasa uses. It covers Tensorflow, `asyncio`, APScheduler, SocketIO, Matplotlib, RabbitMQ, Kafka.
2. LOG_LEVEL_MATPLOTLIB: This is the specialized environment variable to configure log level only for Matplotlib.
3. LOG_LEVEL_RABBITMQ: This is the specialized environment variable to configure log level only for AMQP libraries, at the moment it handles log levels from `aio_pika` and `aiormq`.
4. LOG_LEVEL_KAFKA: This is the specialized environment variable to configure log level only for kafka.
5. LOG_LEVEL_PRESIDIO: This is the specialized environment variable to configure log level only for Presidio, at the moment it handles log levels from `presidio_analyzer` and `presidio_anonymizer`.
6. LOG_LEVEL_FAKER: This is the specialized environment variable to configure log level only for Faker.

General configuration (`LOG_LEVEL_LIBRARIES`) has less priority than library level specific configuration (`LOG_LEVEL_MATPLOTLIB`, `LOG_LEVEL_RABBITMQ` etc); and CLI parameter sets the lowest level log messages which will be handled. This means variables can be used together with a predictable result. As an example:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL_LIBRARIES=ERROR LOG_LEVEL_MATPLOTLIB=WARNING LOG_LEVEL_KAFKA=DEBUG rasa shell --debug
```

The above command run will result in showing:
- messages with `DEBUG` level and higher by default (due to `--debug`)
- messages with `WARNING` level and higher for Matplotlib
- messages with `DEBUG` level and higher for kafka
- messages with `ERROR` level and higher for other libraries not configured

Note that CLI config sets the lowest level log messages to be handled, hence the following command will set the log level to `INFO` (due to `--verbose`) and no debug messages will be seen (library level configuration will not have any effect):

```bash
LOG_LEVEL_LIBRARIES=DEBUG LOG_LEVEL_MATPLOTLIB=DEBUG rasa shell --verbose
```

As an aside, CLI log level sets the level at the root logger (which has the important handler - `coloredlogs` handler); this means even if an environment variable sets a library logger to a lower level, the root logger will reject messages from that library. If not specified, the CLI log level is set to `INFO`.

## Custom logging configuration

:::info New in 3.4

The Rasa CLI now includes a new argument `--logging-config-file` which accepts a YAML file as value.

:::

You can now configure any logging formatters or handlers in a separate YAML file.
The logging config YAML file must follow the [Python built-in dictionary schema](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#dictionary-schema-details), otherwise it will fail validation.
You can pass this file as argument to the `--logging-config-file` CLI option and use it with any of the rasa commands.

## rasa init

This command sets up a complete assistant for you with some example training data:

```bash
rasa init
```

It creates the following files:

```bash
.
├── actions
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── actions.py
├── config.yml
├── credentials.yml
├── data
│   ├── nlu.yml
|   ├── rules.yml
│   └── stories.yml
├── domain.yml
├── endpoints.yml
├── models
│   └── <timestamp>.tar.gz
└── tests
   └── test_stories.yml
```

It will ask you if you want to train an initial model using this data.
If you answer no, the `models` directory will be empty.

Any of the default CLI commands will expect this project setup, so this is the
best way to get started. You can run `rasa train`, `rasa shell` and `rasa test`
without any additional configuration.

## rasa train

The following command trains a Rasa model:

```bash
rasa train
```
If you have existing models in your directory (under `models/` by default), only
the parts of your model that have changed will be re-trained. For example, if you edit
your NLU training data and nothing else, only the NLU part will be trained.

If you want to train an NLU or dialogue model individually, you can run
`rasa train nlu` or `rasa train core`. If you provide training data only for one one of
these, `rasa train` will fall back to one of these commands by default.

`rasa train` will store the trained model in the directory defined by `--out`, `models/` by default.
The name of the model by default is `<timestamp>.tar.gz`. If you want to name your model differently,
you can specify the name using the `--fixed-model-name` flag.

By default validation is run before training the model. If you want to skip validation, you can use the `--skip-validation` flag.
If you want to fail on validation warnings, you can use the `--fail-on-validation-warnings` flag.
The `--validation-max-history` is analogous to the `--max-history` argument of `rasa data validate`. 

The following arguments can be used to configure the training process:

```text [rasa train --help]
```

See the section on [data augmentation](./policies.mdx#data-augmentation) for info on how data augmentation works
and how to choose a value for the flag. Note that `TEDPolicy` is the only policy affected by data augmentation.

See the following section on [incremental training](#incremental-training) for more information about the `--epoch-fraction` argument.


### Incremental training

:::info New in 2.2
This feature is experimental.
We introduce experimental features to get feedback from our community, so we encourage you to try it out!
However, the functionality might be changed or removed in the future.
If you have feedback (positive or negative) please share it with us on the [Rasa Forum](https://forum.rasa.com).

:::

In order to improve the performance of an assistant, it's helpful to practice [CDD](./conversation-driven-development.mdx)
and add new training examples based on how your users have talked to your assistant. You can use `rasa train --finetune`
to initialize the pipeline with an already trained model and further finetune it on the
new training dataset that includes the additional training examples. This will help reduce the
training time of the new model.

By default, the command picks up the latest model in the `models/` directory. If you have a specific model
which you want to improve, you may specify the path to this by
running `rasa train --finetune <path to model to finetune>`. Finetuning a model usually
requires fewer epochs to train machine learning components like `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector` and `TEDPolicy` compared to training from scratch.
Either use a model configuration for finetuning
which defines fewer epochs than before or use the flag
`--epoch-fraction`. `--epoch-fraction` will use a fraction of the epochs specified for each machine learning component
in the model configuration file. For example, if `DIETClassifier` is configured to use 100 epochs,
specifying `--epoch-fraction 0.5` will only use 50 epochs for finetuning.

You can also finetune an NLU-only or dialogue management-only model by using
`rasa train nlu --finetune` and `rasa train core --finetune` respectively.

To be able to fine tune a model, the following conditions must be met:

1. The configuration supplied should be exactly the same as the
configuration used to train the model which is being finetuned.
The only parameter that you can change is `epochs` for the individual machine learning components and policies.

2. The set of labels(intents, actions, entities and slots) for which the base model is trained
should be exactly the same as the ones present in the training data used for finetuning. This
means that you cannot add new intent, action, entity or slot labels to your training data
during incremental training. You can still add new training examples for each of the existing
labels. If you have added/removed labels in the training data, the pipeline needs to be trained
from scratch.

3. The model to be finetuned is trained with `MINIMUM_COMPATIBLE_VERSION` of the currently installed rasa version.

## rasa interactive

You can start an interactive learning session by running:

```bash
rasa interactive
```

This will first train a model and then start an interactive shell session.
You can then correct your assistants predictions as you talk to it.
If [`UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`](./policies.mdx#unexpected-intent-policy) is
included in the pipeline, [`action_unlikely_intent`](./default-actions.mdx#action_unlikely_intent)
can be triggered at any conversation turn. Subsequently, the following message will be displayed:

```
 The bot wants to run 'action_unlikely_intent' to indicate that the last user message was unexpected
 at this point in the conversation. Check out UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy docs to learn more.
```

As the message states, this is an indication that you have explored a conversation path
which is unexpected according to the current set of training stories and hence adding this
path to training stories is recommended. Like other bot actions, you can choose to confirm
or deny running this action.


If you provide a trained model using the `--model` argument, training is skipped
and that model will be loaded instead.

During interactive learning, Rasa will plot the current conversation
and a few similar conversations from the training data to help you
keep track of where you are. You can view the visualization
at http://localhost:5005/visualization.html
as soon as the session has started. This diagram can take some time to generate.
To skip the visualization, run `rasa interactive --skip-visualization`.

:::info Add the `assistant_id` key introduced in 3.5

Running interactive learning with a pre-trained model whose metadata does not include the `assistant_id`
will exit with an error. If this happens, add the required key with a unique identifier value in `config.yml`
and re-run training.

:::


The following arguments can be used to configure the interactive learning session:

```text [rasa interactive --help]
```

## rasa shell

You can start a chat session by running:

```bash
rasa shell
```

By default, this will load up the latest trained model.
You can specify a different model to be loaded by using the `--model` flag.

If you start the shell with an NLU-only model, `rasa shell` will output the
intents and entities predicted for any message you enter.

If you have trained a combined Rasa model but only want to see what your model
extracts as intents and entities from text, you can use the command `rasa shell nlu`.

To increase the logging level for debugging, run:

```bash
rasa shell --debug
```

:::note
In order to see the typical greetings and/or session start behavior you might see
in an external channel, you will need to explicitly send `/session_start`
as the first message. Otherwise, the session start behavior will begin as described in
[Session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-configuration).
:::

The following arguments can be used to configure the command.
Most arguments overlap with `rasa run`; see the [following section](#rasa-run) for more info on those arguments.

Note that the `--connector` argument will always be set to `cmdline` when running `rasa shell`.
This means all credentials in your credentials file will be ignored,
and if you provide your own value for the `--connector` argument it will also be ignored.


```text [rasa shell --help]
```


## rasa run

To start a server running your trained model, run:

```bash
rasa run
```

By default the Rasa server uses HTTP for its communication. To secure the communication with
SSL and run the server on HTTPS, you need to provide a valid certificate and the corresponding
private key file. You can specify these files as part of the `rasa run` command.
If you encrypted your keyfile with a password during creation,
you need to add the `--ssl-password` as well.

```bash
rasa run --ssl-certificate myssl.crt --ssl-keyfile myssl.key --ssl-password mypassword
```

Rasa by default listens on each available network interface. You can limit this to a specific
network interface using the `-i` command line option.

```bash
rasa run -i 192.168.69.150
```

Rasa will by default connect to all channels specified in your credentials file.
To connect to a single channel and ignore all other channels in your credentials file,
specify the name of the channel in the `--connector` argument.

```bash
rasa run --connector rest
```

The name of the channel should match the name you specify in your credentials file.
For supported channels see [the page about messaging and voice channels](./messaging-and-voice-channels.mdx).

The following arguments can be used to configure your Rasa server:

```text [rasa run --help]
```

For more information on the additional parameters, see [Model Storage](./model-storage.mdx).
See the Rasa [HTTP API](./http-api.mdx) page for detailed documentation of all the endpoints.

## rasa run actions

To start an action server with the Rasa SDK, run:

```bash
rasa run actions
```

The following arguments can be used to adapt the server settings:

```text [rasa run actions --help]
```

## rasa visualize

To generate a graph of your stories in the browser, run:

```bash
rasa visualize
```

If your stories are located somewhere other than the default location `data/`,
you can specify their location with the `--stories` flag.

The following arguments can be used to configure this command:

```text [rasa visualize --help]
```

## rasa test

To evaluate a model on your test data, run:

```bash
rasa test
```

This will test your latest trained model on any end-to-end stories you have
defined in files with the `test_` prefix.
If you want to use a different model, you can specify it using the `--model` flag.

To evaluate the dialogue and NLU
models separately, use the commands below:

```bash
rasa test core
```
and

```bash
rasa test nlu
```

You can find more details on specific arguments for each testing type in
[Evaluating an NLU Model](./testing-your-assistant.mdx#evaluating-an-nlu-model) and
[Evaluating a Dialogue Management Model](./testing-your-assistant.mdx#evaluating-a-dialogue-model).

The following arguments are available for `rasa test`:

```text [rasa test --help]
```

## rasa test e2e

<RasaProLabel />

<RasaProBanner />

:::info New in 3.5

You can now use end-to-end testing to test your assistant as a whole, including dialogue management and custom actions.

:::

To run [end-to-end testing](./testing-your-assistant.mdx#end-to-end-testing) on your trained model, run:

```bash
rasa test e2e
```

This will test your latest trained model on any end-to-end test cases you have.
If you want to use a different model, you can specify it using the `--model` flag.

The following arguments are available for `rasa test e2e`:

```text
usage: rasa test e2e [-h] [-v] [-vv] [--quiet] [--logging-config-file LOGGING_CONFIG_FILE] [--fail-fast] [-o] [--remote-storage REMOTE_STORAGE] [-m MODEL] [--endpoints ENDPOINTS] [path-to-test-cases]

Runs end-to-end testing.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o, --e2e-results     Results file containing end-to-end testing summary. (default: None)
  --remote-storage REMOTE_STORAGE
                        Set the remote location where your Rasa model is stored, e.g. on AWS. (default: None)
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Path to a trained Rasa model. If a directory is specified, it will use the latest model in this directory. (default: models)
  --endpoints ENDPOINTS
                        Configuration file for the model server and the connectors as a yml file. (default: endpoints.yml)

Python Logging Options:
  You can control level of log messages printed. In addition to these arguments, a more fine grained configuration can be achieved with environment variables. See online documentation for more info.

  -v, --verbose         Be verbose. Sets logging level to INFO. (default: None)
  -vv, --debug          Print lots of debugging statements. Sets logging level to DEBUG. (default: None)
  --quiet               Be quiet! Sets logging level to WARNING. (default: None)
  --logging-config-file LOGGING_CONFIG_FILE
                        If set, the name of the logging configuration file will be set to the given name. (default: None)

Testing Settings:
  path-to-test-cases    Input file or folder containing end-to-end test cases. (default: tests/e2e_test_cases.yml)
  --fail-fast           Fail the test suite as soon as a unit test fails. (default: False)
```

## rasa data split

To create a train-test split of your NLU training data, run:

```bash
rasa data split nlu
```

This will create a 80/20 split of train/test data by default.
You can specify the training data, the fraction, and the output directory using
the following arguments:

```text [rasa data split nlu --help]
```

If you have NLG data for retrieval actions, this will be saved to separate files:

```bash
ls train_test_split

      nlg_test_data.yml     test_data.yml
      nlg_training_data.yml training_data.yml
```

To split your stories, you can use the following command:

```bash
rasa data split stories
```

It has the same arguments as `split nlu` command, but loads yaml files with stories and perform random splitting.
Directory `train_test_split` will contain all yaml files processed with prefixes `train_` or `test_` containing
train and test parts.

## rasa data convert nlu

You can convert NLU data from
- LUIS data format,
- WIT data format,
- Dialogflow data format, or
- JSON

to
- YAML or
- JSON

You can start the converter by running:

```bash
rasa data convert nlu
```

You can specify the input file or directory, output file or directory, and the output format with the following arguments:

```text [rasa data convert nlu --help]
```

## rasa data migrate

The domain is the only data file whose format changed between 2.0 and 3.0.
You can automatically migrate a 2.0 domain to the 3.0 format.

You can start the migration by running:

```bash
rasa data migrate
```

You can specify the input file or directory and the output file or directory with the following arguments:

```bash
rasa data migrate -d DOMAIN --out OUT_PATH
```

If no arguments are specified, the default domain path (`domain.yml`) will be used for both input and output files.

This command will also back-up your 2.0 domain file(s) into a different `original_domain.yml` file or
directory labeled `original_domain`.

Note that the slots in the migrated domain will contain [mapping conditions](./domain.mdx#mapping-conditions) if these
slots are part of a form's `required_slots`.

:::caution
Exceptions will be raised and the migration process terminated if invalid domain files are provided or if they are
already in the 3.0 format, if slots or forms are missing from your original files or if the slots or forms sections
are spread across multiple domain files.
This is done to avoid duplication of migrated sections in your domain files.
Please make sure all your slots' or forms' definitions are grouped into a single file.

:::

You can learn more about this command by running:

```bash
rasa data migrate --help
```

## rasa data validate

You can check your domain, NLU data, or story data for mistakes and inconsistencies.
To validate your data, run this command:

```bash
rasa data validate
```

The validator searches for errors in the data, e.g. two intents that have some
identical training examples.
The validator also checks if you have any stories where different assistant actions follow from the same
dialogue history. Conflicts between stories will prevent a model from learning the correct
pattern for a dialogue.

:::info Searching for the `assistant_id` key introduced in 3.5

The validator will check whether the `assistant_id` key is present in the config file and will issue a warning if this
key is missing or if the default value has not been changed.

:::

If you pass a `max_history` value to one or more policies in your `config.yml` file, provide the
smallest of those values in the validator command using the `--max-history <max_history>` flag.

You can also validate only the story structure by running this command:

```bash
rasa data validate stories
```

:::note
Running `rasa data validate` does **not** test if your [rules](./rules.mdx) are consistent with your stories.
However, during training, the `RulePolicy` checks for conflicts between rules and stories. Any such conflict will abort training.

Also, if you use end-to-end stories, then this might not capture all conflicts. Specifically, if two user inputs
result in different tokens yet exactly the same featurization, then conflicting actions after these inputs
may exist but will not be reported by the tool.

To interrupt validation even for minor issues such as unused intents or responses, use the `--fail-on-warnings` flag.

:::caution check your story names
The `rasa data validate stories` command assumes that all your story names are unique!
:::

You can use `rasa data validate` with additional arguments, e.g. to specify the location of your data and
domain files:

```text [rasa data validate --help]
```

## rasa export

To export events from a tracker store using an event broker, run:

```bash
rasa export
```

You can specify the location of the environments file, the minimum and maximum
timestamps of events that should be published, as well as the conversation IDs that
should be published:

```text [rasa export --help]
```

:::tip Import conversations into Rasa X/Enterprise
This command is most commonly used to import old conversations into Rasa X/Enterprise to annotate
them. Read more about [importing conversations into Rasa X/Enterprise](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-enterprise/installation-and-setup/deploy#1-import-existing-conversations-from-rasa-open-source).

## rasa evaluate markers

:::caution

This feature is currently experimental and might change or be removed in the future. Share your feedback in the forum to help us make it production-ready.

:::

The following command applies the [markers](./markers.mdx) you defined in your marker configuration file,
to pre-existing dialogues stored in your [tracker store](./tracker-stores.mdx), and produces `.csv` files containing
the extracted markers and summary statistics:

```bash
rasa evaluate markers all extracted_markers.csv
```

Use the following arguments to configure the marker extraction process:

```
usage: rasa evaluate markers [-h] [-v] [-vv] [--quiet] [--config CONFIG] [--no-stats | --stats-file-prefix [STATS_FILE_PREFIX]] [--endpoints ENDPOINTS] [-d DOMAIN] output_filename {first_n,sample,all} ...

positional arguments:
  output_filename       The filename to write the extracted markers to (CSV format).
  {first_n,sample,all}
    first_n             Select trackers sequentially until N are taken.
    sample              Select trackers by sampling N.
    all                 Select all trackers.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG       The config file(s) containing marker definitions. This can be a single YAML file, or a directory that contains several files with marker definitions in it. The content of these files will be read and
                        merged together. (default: markers.yml)
  --no-stats            Do not compute summary statistics. (default: True)
  --stats-file-prefix [STATS_FILE_PREFIX]
                        The common file prefix of the files where we write out the compute statistics. More precisely, the file prefix must consist of a common path plus a common file prefix, to which suffixes `-overall.csv` and
                        `-per-session.csv` will be added automatically. (default: stats)
  --endpoints ENDPOINTS
                        Configuration file for the tracker store as a yml file. (default: endpoints.yml)
  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                        Domain specification. This can be a single YAML file, or a directory that contains several files with domain specifications in it. The content of these files will be read and merged together. (default:
                        domain.yml)

Python Logging Options:
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose. Sets logging level to INFO. (default: None)
  -vv, --debug          Print lots of debugging statements. Sets logging level to DEBUG. (default: None)
  --quiet               Be quiet! Sets logging level to WARNING. (default: None)
```
