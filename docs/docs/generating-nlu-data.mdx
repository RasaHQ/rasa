NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is the part of Rasa Open Source that performs
intent classification, entity extraction, and response retrieval.

NLU will take in a sentence such as "I am looking for a French restaurant in the center
of town" and return structured data like:

```json
{
  "intent": "search_restaurant",
  "entities": {
    "cuisine": "French",
    "location": "center"
  }
}
```

Building NLU models is hard, and building ones that are production-ready is even harder.
Here are some tips for designing your NLU training data and pipeline to get the most
out of your bot.

## Conversation-Driven Development for NLU

Conversation-Driven Development (CDD) means letting real user conversations guide your
development. For building a great NLU model, this means two key things:

### Gather Real Data
When it comes to building out NLU training data, developers often rely on text
generation tools to quickly increase the number of training examples. While this
approach can be time-saving, it makes NLU models prone to overfit data that is not
representative of things a real user would say.

To avoid such a problem, it is always a good idea to collect as much real user data
as possible to use as training data. Even though your bot will make mistakes initially,
the process of training & evaluating on user data will enable your model to generalize
much more effectively in real-world scenarios.

### Share with Test Users Early

In order to gather real data, you’re going to need real user messages. A bot developer
can only come up with a limited range of examples, and users will always surprise you
with what they say. This means you should share your bot with test users outside the
development team as early as possible.
See the full [CDD guidelines](./conversation-driven-development.mdx) for more details.

## Avoiding Intent Confusion

Intents are classified using character and word-level features extracted from your
training examples, depending on what [featurizers](./components/featurizers.mdx)
you've added to your NLU pipeline. When different intents contain the same
words ordered in a similar fashion, this can create confusion for the intent classifier.

### Splitting on Entities vs Intents

Intent confusion often occurs when you want your assistant's response to be conditioned on
information provided by the user. For example, 
"How do I migrate to Rasa from IBM Watson?" versus "I want to migrate from Dialogflow."

Since each of these messages will lead to a different response, your initial approach might be to create
separate intents for each migration type, e.g. `watson_migration` and `dialogflow_migration`.
However, these intents are trying to achieve the same goal (migrating to Rasa) and will 
likely be phrased similarly, which may cause the model to confuse these intents.

To avoid intent confusion, group these training examples into single `migration` intent and make
the response depend on the value of a categorical `product` slot that comes from an entity.
This also makes it easy to handle the case when no entity is provided,
e.g. "How do I migrate to Rasa?" For example:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: migrate from IBM Watson
  steps:
    - intent: migration
      entities:
      - product
    - slot_was_set:
      - product: Watson
    - action: utter_watson_migration

- story: migrate from Dialogflow
  steps:
    - intent: migration
      entities:
      - product
    - slot_was_set:
      - product: Dialogflow
    - action: utter_dialogflow_migration

- story: migrate from unspecified
  steps:
    - intent: migration
    - action: utter_ask_migration_product
```

## Improving Entity Recognition

With Rasa Open Source, you can define custom entities and annotate them in your training data
to teach your model to recognize them. Rasa Open Source also provides components 
to extract pre-trained entities, as well as other forms of training data to help
your model recognize and process entities.

### Pre-trained Entity Extractors

Common entities such as names, addresses, and cities require a large amount of training
data for an NLU model to generalize effectively. 

Rasa Open Source provides two great options for
pre-trained extraction: [SpacyEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors/#SpacyEntityExtractor)
and [DucklingEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors/#DucklingHTTPExtractor).
Because these extractors have been pre-trained on a large corpus of data, you can use them
to extract the entities they support without annotating them in your training data.

### Regexes

Regexes are useful for performing entity extraction on structured patterns such as 5-digit
U.S. zip codes. Regex patterns can be used to generate features for the NLU model to learn,
or as a method of direct entity matching.
See [Regular Expression Features](./training-data-format/#regular-expression-features)
for more information.

### Lookup Tables

Lookup tables are processed as a regex pattern that checks if any of the lookup table
entries exist in the training example. Similar to regexes, lookup tables can be used
to provide features to the model to improve entity recognition, or used to perform
match-based entity recognition. Examples of useful applications of lookup tables are
flavors of ice cream, brands of bottled water, and even sock length styles
(see [Lookup Tables](./training-data-format/#lookup-tables)).

### Synonyms

Adding synonyms to your training data is useful for mapping certain entity values to a
single normalized entity. Synonyms, however, are not meant for improving your model's
entity recognition and have no effect on NLU performance.

A good use case for synonyms is when normalizing entities belonging to distinct groups.
For example, in an assistant that asks users what insurance policies they're interested
in, they might respond with "my truck," "a car," or "I drive a batmobile."
It would be a good idea to map `truck`, `car`, and `batmobile` to the normalized value
`auto` so that the processing logic will only need to account for a narrow set of
possibilities (see [Entity Synonyms](./training-data-format/#entity-synonyms)).

## Handling Edge Cases

### Misspellings

Coming across misspellings is inevitable, so your bot needs an effective way to
handle this. Keep in mind that the goal is not to correct misspellings, but to
correctly identify intents and entities. For this reason, while a spellchecker may
seem like an obvious solution, adjusting your featurizers and training data is often
sufficient to account for misspellings. 

Adding a character-level featurizer provides
an effective defense against spelling errors by accounting for parts of words, instead
of only whole words. You can add character level featurization to your pipeline by
using the `char_wb` analyzer for the `CountVectorsFeaturizer`, for example:

```yaml-rasa
pipeline:
# <other components> 
- name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  analyze: char_wb
  min_ngram: 1
  max_ngram: 4
# <other components> 
```

In addition to character-level featurization, you can add common misspellings to
your training data.

### Defining an Out-of-scope Intent

It is always a good idea to define an `out_of_scope` intent in your bot to capture
any user messages outside of your bot's domain. When an `out_of_scope` intent is
identified, you can respond with messages such as "I'm not sure how to handle that,
here are some things you can ask me..." to gracefully guide the user towards a
supported skill.

## Shipping Updates

Treat your data like code. In the same way that you would never ship code updates
without reviews, updates to your training data should be carefully reviewed because
of the significant influence it can have on your model's performance.

Use a version control system such as Github or Bitbucket to track changes to your
data and rollback updates when necessary.

Be sure to build tests for your NLU models to [evaluate performance](./testing-your-assistant.mdx) as training data
and hyper-parameters change. Automate these tests in a [CI pipeline](./setting-up-ci-cd.mdx) such as Jenkins
or Git Workflow to streamline your development process and ensure that only
high-quality updates are shipped.
