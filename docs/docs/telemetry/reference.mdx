title: Telemetry Event Reference
abstract: |
  Event descriptions of telemetry data we report in order to improve our products.
---
Telemetry events are only reported if telemetry is enabled. A detailed explanation 
on the reasoning behind collecting optional telemetry events can be found in our 
[telemetry documentation](./telemetry.mdx).
