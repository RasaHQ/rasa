Rasa Pro is compromised of two packages. The packages need to be installed
separately and in different environments:

- **Rasa Plus**, a drop in replacement for Rasa Open Source for an
  enterprise deployment. Rasa Plus should be used to deploy your assistant
  into production.
- **Rasa Pro Services**, flexible infrastructure and APIs on top of Rasa
  Open Source. Rasa Pro Services should be deployed alongside, but separately
  from your production assistant.

## Rasa Plus

## Rasa Pro Services

Installation of the data pipeline requires the deployment of a docker
container. The container will receive data from a Kafka instance and
write information into a database.

### Prerequisites

#### Existing Services

- A production deployment of Kafka is required to set up Rasa Pro.
  We recommend to use [Amazon Managed Streaming for
  Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/).
- A production deployment of a data lake needs to be connected to
  the data pipeline. Rasa Pro support the following data lakes:
  1. [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) (recommended)
  2. [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) (version >= 11)

#### Hardware requirements

:::warning
TODO: add once we have done load testing. add minimal and recommended.
should be aligned with AWS machine types.

- CPU
- Disk
- Memory

### Installation and Configuration

Rasa Plus streams data to Kafka which gets consumed by Rasa Pro Services.
The different services need to be run and configured to be able to communicate.

1.  Configure Rasa Plus to stream data to Kafka. The configuration for
    Kafka should be put in a configuration
    file `endpoints.yml`:

    ```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
    event_broker:
      type: kafka
      partition_by_sender: True
      topic: rasa-events
      url: <BROKER URL>
    ```

    The `<BROKER_URL>` needs to be replaced with an address of a bootstrap
    server of your Kafka cluster. Configuration examples for different
    security protocols and other parameters can be found in the
    [Kafka Event Broker](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/event-brokers/#kafka-event-broker)
    documentation.

2.  Rasa Pro Services is a docker image. Authenticate to pull
    the docker images:

    ```shell
    gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev
    ```

    Pull the Rasa Pro Services image to your machine:

    ```shell
    docker pull europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-pro/rasa-pro-services
    ```

3.  Run the Rasa Pro Services docker image and configure it to receive data
    from your Rasa Plus assistant connected to Kafka:

    ```shell
    docker run \
        -e FRAMEWORK_PLUS_LICENSE=<your_license> \
        -e KAFKA_BROKER_ADDRESS=<BROKER_URL> \
        -e KAFKA_TOPIC=rasa-events \
        -e RASA_ANALYTICS_DB_USER=<DATA_LAKE_USER> \
        -e RASA_ANALYTICS_DB_PASSWORD=<DATA_LAKE_PASSWORD> \
        -e RASA_ANALYTICS_DB_URL=<DATA_LAKE_URL> \
        europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/rasa-releases/rasa-pro/rasa-pro-services
    ```

    The `<DATA_LAKE_URL>` should have a JDBC format, e.g.
    `jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/rasa`. If no data lake URL is configured,
    the [Analytics](analytics.mdx) will be disabled

    For production deployments we recommend to us
    [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/).
