## Overview

Rasa Open Source uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) as
a unified and extendable way to manage all training data,
including NLU data, stories and rules. 

With the YAML format, training data can be split over any number of YAML files,
and every file can contain any kind of data. 
The training data parser will read the top level keys in each file to decide
what kind of data is in a section at training time.

The [domain](../glossary#domain) uses
the same YAML format as the training data and can also be split across
multiple files or combined with training data in one file. The domain includes
the definitions for [responses](../core/domains#responses) and [forms](../core/forms).
See the [documentation for domains](../core/domains) for information on how to format your domain file.

:::note
See the documentation for Rasa Open Source 1.x for the previous (now deprecated) formats for [NLU](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/training-data-format/) and [stories](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/stories/).
:::

### High-Level Structure

Each file can contain one or more **keys** with corresponding training
data. One file can contain multiple keys, as long as there is not more
than one of a certain key in a single file. The available keys are:

- `version`
- `nlu`
- `stories`
- `rules`
- `e2e_tests`

All YAML training data files should specify the `version` key to be parsed
correctly. If you don't specify a version key in your training data file, Rasa
will assume you are using the latest training data format specification supported
by the version of Rasa Open Source you have installed.
Training data files with a version greater than is currently available in 
the version of Rasa Open Source you have installed will be
skipped.
Currently, the latest training data format specification for Rasa 2.x is 2.0.

### Example

Here's a short example which keeps all training data in a single file:

```yaml
version: "2.0"

stories:
- story: greet and faq
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq

rules:
- rule: Greet user
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet

nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
  - Hey
  - Hi
  - hey there [Sara](name)

- intent: faq/language
  examples: |
  - What language do you speak?
  - Do you only handle english?

e2e_tests:
- user: |
    hey
  intent: greet
- action: utter_greet
- user: |
    what language do you speak
  intent: faq/language
- action: respond_faq
```


## NLU Training Data

[NLU](../glossary#nlu) training data consists of example user utterances categorized by
**intent**, i.e. what the user is trying to convey or accomplish with their
message. Training examples can also include **entities**. Entities are structured
pieces of information that can be extracted from a user's message. You can also
add extra information such as regular expressions and lookup tables to your 
training data to help the model identify intents and entities correctly.

NLU training data is defined under the `nlu` key. Items that can be added under this key are:

- [Training examples](#training-examples) grouped by user intent e.g.
  optionally with annotated [entities](#entities)

```yaml
- intent: check_balance
  examples: |
  - What's my [credit](account) balance?
  - What's the balance on my [credit card account]{"entity":"account","value":"credit"}
```

- [Synonyms](#synonyms)

```yaml
- synonym: credit
  examples: |
  - credit card account
  - credit account
```

- [Regular expressions](#regular-expression-features)

```yaml
- regex: account_number
  examples: |
  - \d{10:12}
```

- [Lookup tables](#lookup-tables)

```yaml
- lookup: banks
  examples: |
  - JPMC
  - Comerica
  - Bank of America
```

### Training Examples

Training examples are grouped by [intent](../glossary#intent) and listed under the
`examples` key. Usually, you'll list one example per line as follows:

```yaml
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
  - hey
  - hi
  - whats up
```

However, it's also possible to use an extended format if you have a custom NLU component and need metadata for your examples:


```yaml
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: 
  - text: |
      hi
    metadata:
      sentiment: neutral
  - text: |
      hey there!
```

The `metadata` key can contain arbitrary key-value data that stays with an example and is accessible by the componenets in the NLU pipeline. In the example above, the sentiment of 
the example could be used by a custom component in the pipeline for sentiment analysis.

### Entities

[Entities](../glossary#entity) are structured pieces of information that can be extracted from a user's message. For entity extraction to work, you need to either specify training data to train an ML model or you need to define [regular expressions](#regular-expressions-for-entity-extraction) to extract entities using the [`RegexEntityExtractor`](../nlu/components#regexentityextractor) based on a character pattern.

Entities are annotated in training examples with minimally the entity's name. 
In addition to the entity name, you can annotate an entity with synonyms, roles, or groups.

The syntax for annotating an entity is: 

```yaml
[<entity-text>]{"entity": "<entity name>", "role": "<role name>", "group": "<group name>", "value": "<entity synonym>"}
```

The keywords `role`, `group`, and `value` are optional in this notation.
The `value` keyword refers to synonyms, which are explained in the
following section. To understand what the labels `role` and `group` are
for, see the section on (entity roles and groups)[nlu/entity-extraction#entities-roles-and-groups].

In training examples, entity annotation would look like this:

```yaml
nlu:
- intent: check_balance
  examples: |
  - how much do I have on my [savings]("account") account
  - how much money is in my [checking]{"entity": "account"} account
  - What's the balance on my [credit card account]{"entity":"account","value":"credit"}

```

### Synonyms

Synonyms provide a way to normalize your training data by mapping an
extracted entity to a value other than the literal text extracted.
Synonyms can be defined in the format:

```yaml
- synonym: credit
  examples: |
  - credit card account
  - credit account
```

Synonyms can also be defined in-line in your training examples by
specifying the `value` of the entity:

```yaml
nlu:
- intent: check_balance
  examples: |
  - how much do I have on my [credit card account]{"entity": "account", "value": "credit"}
  - how much do I owe on my [credit account]{"entity": "account", "value": "credit"}
```

To use the synonyms defined in your training data, you need to make sure the
pipeline in your configuration file contains the
[`EntitySynonymMapper`](../nlu/components#entitysynonymmapper) component. You
should define synonyms when there are multiple ways users refer to the same
thing.

#### Example 

Let's say you had an entity `account`, and you expect the
value "credit". Your users also refer to their "credit" account as "credit
account" and "credit card account".

In this case, you could define "credit card account" and "credit account" as
**synonyms** to "credit", as in the examples above.

Then, if either of these phrases is extracted as an entity, it will be
mapped to the **value** `credit`.

:::note
Synonym mapping only happens **after** entities have been extracted.
That means that your training examples should include the synonym examples (`credit card account` and `credit account`) so that the model will learn to recognize these as entities and replace them with `credit`. 
:::

### Regular Expressions

You can use regular expressions to improve intent classification and 
entity extraction in combination with the [`RegexFeaturizer`](../nlu/components#regexfeaturizer) and [`RegexEntityExtractor`](../nlu/components#regexentityextractor) components in the pipeline.

#### Regular Expressions for Intent Classification 

You can use regular expressions to improve intent classification by including the `RegexFeaturizer` component in your pipeline. When using the `RegexFeaturizer`, a regex does not act as a rule for classifying an intent. It only provides a feature that the intent classifier will use 
to learn patterns for intent classification.
Currently, all intent classifiers make use of available regex features. 

The name of a regex in this case is a human readable description. It can help you remember what a regex is used for, and it is the title of the corresponding pattern feature. It does not have to match any intent or entity name. A regex for greeting might look like this: 

```yaml
- regex: greet
  examples: |
  - hey[^\\s]*
```

The intent being matched could be `greet`,`say_hi`, `hallo` or anything else.

Try to create your regular epressions in a way that they match as few
words as possible. E.g. using `hey[^\\s]*` instead of `hey.*`, as the
later one might match the whole message whereas the first one only
matches a single word.

#### Regular Expressions for Entity Extraction

If your entity has a deterministic structure (like an account number), you can use regular expressions in one of two ways:

1. As features for the [`RegexFeaturizer`](../nlu/components#regexfeaturizer) component in the pipeline.

  When used as as features for the `RegexFeaturizer` the
  name of the regular expression does not matter.

  Regex features for entity extraction
  are currently only supported by the `CRFEntityExtractor` and the
  `DIETClassifier` component. Other entity extractors, like
  `MitieEntityExtractor` or `SpacyEntityExtractor`, won't use the generated
  features and their presence will not improve entity recognition for
  these extractors. 

2. For rule-based entity extraction using the [`RegexEntityExtractor`](../nlu/components#regexentityextractor) component in the pipeline.

  When using the `RegexEntityExtractor`, the name of the regular expression should
  match the name of the entity you want to extract.

In both cases, the format for defining the regex is the same.
For example, a regex for extracting a bank account number that is 10-12 digits long mightlook like this:

```yaml
- regex: account_number
  examples: |
  - \d{10:12}
```


:::note

When using the `RegexFeaturizer`, a regular expression only provides a feature
that helps the model learn an association between intents/entities and inputs
that fit the regular expression. In order for the model to learn this association,
you must provide example inputs that include that regular expression! 
:::


### Lookup Tables

Lookup tables provide a convenient way to supply a list of entity
examples. The format is as follows:

```yaml
- lookup: banks
  examples: |
  - JPMC
  - Bank of America
```

The name of the lookup table is subject to the same constraints as the
name of a regex feature.

When you supply a lookup table in your training data, the contents of that table
are combined into one large regular expression. This regex is used to check
each training example to see if it contains matches for entries in the
lookup table.

Lookup table regexes are processed identically to the regular
regex patterns directly specified in the training data and can be used
either with the [RegexFeaturizer](../nlu/components#regexfeaturizer)
or with the [RegexEntityExtractor](../nlu/components#regexentityextractor).

:::note

If you are using lookup tables in combination with the `RegexFeaturizer`, there must be a few examples of matches  
in your training data. Otherwise the model will not learn to use the
lookup table match features.
:::

:::warning

You have to be careful when you add data to the lookup table.  
For example, if there are false positives or other noise in the table,
this can hurt performance. So make sure your lookup tables contain
clean data.
:::


## Conversation Training Data

Stories and rules are both representations of conversations between a user and a conversational
assistant. They are used to train the dialogue management
model. [**Stories**](stories.mdx) are used to train a machine learning model to identify patterns
in conversations and generalize to unseen conversation paths.
**[Rules](../core/rules)** describe parts of conversations that should always
follow the same path and are used to train the
[RulePolicy](../core/policies#rule-policy). 


### Stories

Stories are composed of:
  
  - `story`: The story's name. The name is arbitrary and not used in training; 
    you can use it as a human-readable reference for the story.
  - `metadata`: arbitrary and optional, not used in training, 
    you can use it to store relevant information about the story
    like e.g. the author
  - a list of `steps`: The user messages and actions that make up the story

For example:

```yaml
stories:
- story: Greet the user
  metadata:
    author: Somebody
    key: value
  steps:
  # list of steps
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

Each step can be one of the following:

  - A [user message](#user-messages), represented by **intent** and **entities**.
  - An [or statement](#or), which includes two or more user messages under it
  - A bot [action](#actions)
  - A [form](#forms)
  - A [slot was set](#slots) event
  - A [checkpoint](#checkpoints), which connects the story to another story


#### User Messages

All user messages are specified with the `intent:`
key and an optional `entities:` key.

While writing stories, you do not have to deal with the specific
contents of the messages that the users send. Instead, you can take
advantage of the output from the NLU pipeline, which lets you use
the combination of an intent and entities to refer to all the possible
messages the users can send to mean the same thing.

User messages follow the format:

```yaml
  steps:
    - intent: <intent name>  # Required
      entities: # Optional
      - <entity_name>: <entity value> 
```

For example, to represent the sentence
`I want to check my credit balance`, where `credit` is an entity:

```yaml
  steps:
    - intent: account_balance
      entities:
      - account_type: credit
    - action: action_credit_account_balance
```

It is important to include the entities here as well because the
policies learn to predict the next action based on a *combination* of
both the intent and entities (you can, however, change this behavior
using the [`use_entities`](#use-entities) attribute).


#### Actions

All actions executed by the bot are specified with the `action:` key followed
by the name of the action.
While writing stories, you will encounter three types of actions:


1. [**Responses**](#responses): start with `utter_` and send a specific message
   to the user. e.g.

```yaml
    steps:
    - intent: greet
    - action: utter_greet
```

2. [**Retrieval actions**](../core/retrieval-actions): start with `respond_` and send a message selected by a retrieval model. e.g.

```yaml
    steps:
    - intent: faq
    - action: respond_faq
```

3. [**Custom actions**](../core/actions#custom-actions): start with `action_`, run arbitrary code and send any number of messages (or none).

```yaml
    steps:
    - intent: feedback
    - action: action_store_feedback
```

#### Forms


A [form](../glossary#form) is a specific kind of custom action that contains the logic to loop over
a set of required slots and ask the user for this information. You [define a form](../core/forms#defining-a-form) in the `forms` section in your domain.
Once defined, the [happy path](../glossary#happy--unhappy-paths)
for a form should be specified as a [rule](../core/forms), but interruptions of forms or 
other "unhappy paths" should be included in stories so that the model can 
generalize to unseen conversation sequences.
As a step in a story, a form takes the following basic format:


```yaml
    steps:
    - intent: find_restaurant
    - action: restaurant_form <!--Activate the form-->
    - form: restaurant_form   <!--This form is currently active-->
    - form: null              <!--Form complete, no form is active-->
    - action: utter_restaurant_found
```


The `action` step activates the form and begins looping over the required slots. The `form: restaurant_form`
step indicates that there is a currently active form. Much like a `slot_was_set` step,
a `form` step doesn't **set** a form to active but indicates that it should already be activated.
In the same way, the  `form: null` step indicates that no form should be active before the subsequent
steps are taken. 

A form can be interrupted and remain active; in this case the interruption should come after the 
`action: <form to activate>` step and be followed by the `form: <active form>` step. 
An interruption of a form could look like this:

```yaml
  - rule: interrupted food
    steps:
      - intent: request_restaurant
      - action: restaurant_form
      - intent: chitchat
      - action: utter_chitchat
      - form: restaurant_form
      - form: null
      - action: utter_slots_values
```


#### Slots

A slot event is specified with the key `slot_was_set:` and optionally
the `value:` key.

**[Slots](../core/slots)** act as the bots memory. 
Slots are **set** by entities or by custom actions and **referenced** by stories in `slot_was_set` steps. For example.

```yaml
    steps:
    - intent: celebrate_bot
    - slot_was_set: feedback_value
      value: positive
    - action: utter_yay
```

This means the story requires that the current value for the `feedback_value`
slot be `positive` for the conversation to continue as specified.

Whether or not you need to include the `value:` depends on the
[slot type](domain.mdx#slot-types) and whether the value can or should
influence the dialogue.

:::note
Stories do not **set** slots. The slot must be set by an entity or custom action **before** the `slot_was_set` step.
:::


#### Checkpoints

Checkpoints are specified with the `checkpoint:` key, either at the beginning
or the end of a story. 


Checkpoints are ways to connect stories together. They can be either the first
or the last step in a story. If they are the last step in a story, that story
will be connected to each other story that starts with the checkpoint of the
same name when the model is trained. Here is an example of a story that ends
with a checkpoint, and one that starts with the same checkpoint:

```yaml
- story: story_with_a_checkpoint_1
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - checkpoint: greet_checkpoint

- story: story_with_a_checkpoint_2
  steps:
  - checkpoint: greet_checkpoint
  - intent: book_flight
  - action: action_book_flight
```

Checkpoints at the beginning of stories can also be conditional on slots being set, for example:

```yaml
- story: story_with_a_conditional_checkpoint
  steps:
  - checkpoint: greet_checkpoint
    # This checkpoint should only apply if slot is set to the specified value
    slots: 
    - context_scenario: holiday
    - holiday_name: thanksgiving
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet_thanksgiving
```


Checkpoints can help simplify your training data and reduce redundancy in it,
but **do not overuse them**. Using lots of checkpoints can quickly make your
stories hard to understand. It makes sense to use them if a sequence of steps
is repeated often in different stories, but stories without checkpoints
are easier to read and write. 

#### OR statement

`or` steps are ways to handle multiple intents the same way,
without writing a separate story for each intent. For example, if you ask the user to confirm something, you might want to treat the `affirm` and `thankyou` intents in the same way. Stories with `or` steps will be converted into multiple
separate stories at training time. For example, the following story would be converted to two stories at training time:

```yaml
- story: story with OR
  steps:
  - intent: signup_newsletter
  - action: utter_ask_confirm
  - or:
    - intent: affirm
    - intent: thanks
  - action: action_signup_newsletter
```

Just like checkpoints, OR statements can be useful, but if you are using a lot of them, it is probably better to restructure your domain and/or intents.

:::warning
Overusing these features (both checkpoints and OR statements) will slow down training.
:::

### Rules

Rules are listed under the `rules` key and look similar to stories. A rule also has a `steps`
key, which contains a list of the same steps as stories do. Rules can additionally
contain the `conversation_started` and `conditions` keys. These are used to specify conditions
under which the rule should apply.

A rule that with a condition looks like this:

```yaml
rules:

- rule: Only say `hey` when the user provided a name
  condition:
  - slot: user_provided_name
    value: true
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

Read more about writing rules [here](../core/rules#writing-a-rule).

## Test Conversations

Test conversations combine both NLU and Core training data into a end-to-end story for evaluation. 

:::warning
This format is only used for end-to-end evaluation and cannot be used for training.
:::

Test conversations are listed under the `e2e_tests` key. 
Their format is similar to the [story](#stories) format,
except that user message steps can include a `user` key which specifies the actual text and entity annotation of the user message. 

Here's an example of a test conversation:

```yaml
e2e_tests:
- story: A basic end-to-end test
  steps:
  - user: |
     hey
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_ask_howcanhelp
  - user: |
     show me [chinese]{"entity": "cuisine"} restaurants
    intent: inform
  - action: utter_ask_location
  - user: |
     in [Paris]{"entity": "location"}
    intent: inform
  - action: utter_ask_price
```
