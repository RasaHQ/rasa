Text featurizers are divided into two different categories: sparse featurizers and dense featurizers.
Sparse featurizers are featurizers that return feature vectors with a lot of missing values, e.g. zeros.
As those feature vectors would normally take up a lot of memory, we store them as sparse features.
Sparse features only store the values that are non zero and their positions in the vector.
Thus, we save a lot of memory and are able to train on larger datasets.

All featurizers can return two different kind of features: sequence features and sentence features.
The sequence features are a matrix of size `(number-of-tokens x feature-dimension)`.
The matrix contains a feature vector for every token in the sequence.
This allows us to train sequence models.
The sentence features are represented by a matrix of size `(1 x feature-dimension)`.
It contains the feature vector for the complete utterance.
The sentence features can be used in any bag-of-words model.
The corresponding classifier can therefore decide what kind of features to use.
Note: The `feature-dimension` for sequence and sentence features does not have to be the same.

## MitieFeaturizer


* **Short**

  Creates a vector representation of user message and response (if specified) using the MITIE featurizer.



* **Outputs**

  `dense_features` for user messages and responses



* **Requires**

  [MitieNLP](../components/language-models.mdx#mitienlp)



* **Type**

  Dense featurizer



* **Description**

  Creates features for entity extraction, intent classification, and response classification using the MITIE
  featurizer.

  :::note
  NOT used by the `MitieIntentClassifier` component. But can be used by any component later in the pipeline
  that makes use of `dense_features`.

  :::



* **Configuration**

  The sentence vector, i.e. the vector of the complete utterance, can be calculated in two different ways, either via
  mean or via max pooling. You can specify the pooling method in your configuration file with the option `pooling`.
  The default pooling method is set to `mean`.

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  - name: "MitieFeaturizer"

  featurizer.



* **Configuration**

  The sentence vector, i.e. the vector of the complete utterance, can be calculated in two different ways, either via
  mean or via max pooling. You can specify the pooling method in your configuration file with the option `pooling`.
  The default pooling method is set to `mean`.

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  - name: "SpacyFeaturizer"
    # Specify what pooling operation should be used to calculate the vector of

## ConveRTFeaturizer


* **Short**

  Creates a vector representation of user message and response (if specified) using
  [ConveRT](https://github.com/PolyAI-LDN/polyai-models) model.



* **Outputs**

  `dense_features` for user messages and responses



* **Requires**

  [ConveRTTokenizer](../components/tokenizers.mdx#converttokenizer)



* **Type**

  Dense featurizer



* **Description**

  Creates features for entity extraction, intent classification, and response selection.
  It uses the [default signature](https://github.com/PolyAI-LDN/polyai-models#tfhub-signatures) to compute vector
  representations of input text.

  :::note
  Since `ConveRT` model is trained only on an English corpus of conversations, this featurizer should only
  be used if your training data is in English language.

  :::

  :::note
  To use `ConveRTTokenizer`, install Rasa Open Source with `pip install rasa[convert]`.

  :::



* **Configuration**

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  - name: "ConveRTFeaturizer"
  ```


## LanguageModelFeaturizer


* **Short**

  Creates a vector representation of user message and response (if specified) using a pre-trained language model.



* **Outputs**

  `dense_features` for user messages and responses



* **Requires**

  [HFTransformersNLP](../components/language-models.mdx#lhftransformersnlp) and [LanguageModelTokenizer](../components/tokenizers.mdx#languagemodeltokenizer)



* **Type**

  Dense featurizer



* **Description**

  Creates features for entity extraction, intent classification, and response selection.
  Uses the pre-trained language model specified in upstream [HFTransformersNLP](../components/language-models.mdx#lhftransformersnlp) component to compute vector
  representations of input text.

  :::note
  Please make sure that you use a language model which is pre-trained on the same language corpus as that of your
  training data.

  :::



* **Configuration**

  Include [HFTransformersNLP](../components/language-models.mdx#lhftransformersnlp) and [LanguageModelTokenizer](../components/tokenizers.mdx#languagemodeltokenizer) components before this component. Use
  [LanguageModelTokenizer](../components/tokenizers.mdx#languagemodeltokenizer) to ensure tokens are correctly set for all components throughout the pipeline.

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  - name: "LanguageModelFeaturizer"
  ```


## RegexFeaturizer


* **Short**

  Creates a vector representation of user message using regular expressions.



* **Outputs**

  `sparse_features` for user messages and `tokens.pattern`



* **Requires**

  `tokens`



* **Type**

  Sparse featurizer



* **Description**

  Creates features for entity extraction and intent classification.
  During training the `RegexFeaturizer` creates a list of regular expressions defined in the training
  data format.
  For each regex, a feature will be set marking whether this expression was found in the user message or not.
  All features will later be fed into an intent classifier / entity extractor to simplify classification (assuming
  the classifier has learned during the training phase, that this set feature indicates a certain intent / entity).
  Regex features for entity extraction are currently only supported by the [CRFEntityExtractor](../components/entity-extractors.mdx#crfentityextractor) and the
  [DIETClassifier](../components/intent-classifiers.mdx#dietclassifier) components!



* **Configuration**

  Make the featurizer case insensitive by adding the `case_sensitive: False` option, the default being
  `case_sensitive: True`.

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  - name: "RegexFeaturizer"
    # Text will be processed with case sensitive as default
    "case_sensitive": True
  ```


## CountVectorsFeaturizer


* **Short**

  Creates bag-of-words representation of user messages, intents, and responses.



* **Outputs**

  `sparse_features` for user messages, intents, and responses



* **Requires**

  `tokens`



* **Type**

  Sparse featurizer



* **Description**

  Creates features for intent classification and response selection.
  Creates bag-of-words representation of user message, intent, and response using
  [sklearn's CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html).
  All tokens which consist only of digits (e.g. 123 and 99 but not a123d) will be assigned to the same feature.



* **Configuration**

  See [sklearn's CountVectorizer docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html)
  for detailed description of the configuration parameters.

  This featurizer can be configured to use word or character n-grams, using the `analyzer` configuration parameter.
  By default `analyzer` is set to `word` so word token counts are used as features.
  If you want to use character n-grams, set `analyzer` to `char` or `char_wb`.
  The lower and upper boundaries of the n-grams can be configured via the parameters `min_ngram` and `max_ngram`.
  By default both of them are set to `1`.

  :::note
  Option `char_wb` creates character n-grams only from text inside word boundaries;
  n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.
  This option can be used to create [Subword Semantic Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07150).

  :::

  :::note
  For character n-grams do not forget to increase `min_ngram` and `max_ngram` parameters.
  Otherwise the vocabulary will contain only single letters.

  :::

  Handling Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words:

  :::note
  Enabled only if `analyzer` is `word`.

  :::

  Since the training is performed on limited vocabulary data, it cannot be guaranteed that during prediction
  an algorithm will not encounter an unknown word (a word that were not seen during training).
  In order to teach an algorithm how to treat unknown words, some words in training data can be substituted
  by generic word `OOV_token`.
  In this case during prediction all unknown words will be treated as this generic word `OOV_token`.

  For example, one might create separate intent `outofscope` in the training data containing messages of
  different number of `OOV_token` s and maybe some additional general words.
  Then an algorithm will likely classify a message with unknown words as this intent `outofscope`.

  You can either set the `OOV_token` or a list of words `OOV_words`:

  * `OOV_token` set a keyword for unseen words; if training data contains `OOV_token` as words in some
    messages, during prediction the words that were not seen during training will be substituted with
    provided `OOV_token`; if `OOV_token=None` (default behavior) words that were not seen during
    training will be ignored during prediction time;

  * `OOV_words` set a list of words to be treated as `OOV_token` during training; if a list of words
    that should be treated as Out-Of-Vocabulary is known, it can be set to `OOV_words` instead of manually
    changing it in training data or using custom preprocessor.

  :::note
  This featurizer creates a bag-of-words representation by **counting** words,
  so the number of `OOV_token` in the sentence might be important.

  :::

  :::note
  Providing `OOV_words` is optional, training data can contain `OOV_token` input manually or by custom
  additional preprocessor.
  Unseen words will be substituted with `OOV_token` **only** if this token is present in the training
  data or `OOV_words` list is provided.

  :::

  If you want to share the vocabulary between user messages and intents, you need to set the option
  `use_shared_vocab` to `True`. In that case a common vocabulary set between tokens in intents and user messages
  is build.

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  - name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
    # Analyzer to use, either 'word', 'char', or 'char_wb'
    "analyzer": "word"
    # Set the lower and upper boundaries for the n-grams
    "min_ngram": 1
    "max_ngram": 1
    # Set the out-of-vocabulary token
    "OOV_token": "_oov_"
    # Whether to use a shared vocab
    "use_shared_vocab": False
  ```

      The above configuration parameters are the ones you should configure to fit your model to your data.
      However, additional parameters exist that can be adapted.

## LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer


* **Short**

  Creates lexical and syntactic features for a user message to support entity extraction.



* **Outputs**

  `sparse_features` for user messages



* **Requires**

  `tokens`



* **Type**

  Sparse featurizer



* **Description**

  Creates features for entity extraction.
  Moves with a sliding window over every token in the user message and creates features according to the
  configuration (see below). As a default configuration is present, you don't need to specify a configuration.



* **Configuration**

  You can configure what kind of lexical and syntactic features the featurizer should extract.
  The following features are available:

  ```
  ==============  ==========================================================================================
  Feature Name    Description
  ==============  ==========================================================================================
  BOS             Checks if the token is at the beginning of the sentence.
  EOS             Checks if the token is at the end of the sentence.
  low             Checks if the token is lower case.
  upper           Checks if the token is upper case.
  title           Checks if the token starts with an uppercase character and all remaining characters are
                  lowercased.
  digit           Checks if the token contains just digits.
  prefix5         Take the first five characters of the token.
  prefix2         Take the first two characters of the token.
  suffix5         Take the last five characters of the token.
  suffix3         Take the last three characters of the token.
  suffix2         Take the last two characters of the token.
  suffix1         Take the last character of the token.
  pos             Take the Part-of-Speech tag of the token (``SpacyTokenizer`` required).
  pos2            Take the first two characters of the Part-of-Speech tag of the token
                  (``SpacyTokenizer`` required).
  ==============  ==========================================================================================
  ```

  As the featurizer is moving over the tokens in a user message with a sliding window, you can define features for
  previous tokens, the current token, and the next tokens in the sliding window.
  You define the features as a [before, token, after] array.
  If you want to define features for the token before, the current token, and the token after,
  your features configuration would look like this:

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
    "features": [
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
      ["BOS", "EOS", "low", "upper", "title", "digit"],
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
    ]
  ```

  This configuration is also the default configuration.

  :::note
  If you want to make use of `pos` or `pos2` you need to add `SpacyTokenizer` to your pipeline.
