## Designing Stories

When designing stories, there are two groups of conversational interactions that need
to be accounted for: happy and unhappy paths. Happy paths describe when the user is
following the conversation flow as you'd expect and always providing the necessary
information when prompted. However, users will often deviate from happy
paths with questions, chit chat, or other asks. We call these unhappy path.

It's important for your bot to handle unhappy paths gracefully, but it's also impossible
to predict what path a given user might take.
Often, developers will try to account for every possible diverging path when designing
unhappy paths. Planning for every possible state in a state machine (many of which will never be reached)
requires a lot of extra work and increases training time significantly.

Instead, we recommend taking a [conversation-driven development](./conversation-driven-development.mdx)
approach when designing unhappy paths.
Conversation-Driven Development promotes sharing your bot as early as possible with test users and
collecting real conversation data that tells you exactly how users diverge from the
happy paths. From this data, you can create stories to accomplish what the user is
requesting and start to think about ways to guide them back into a happy path.


## When to Write Stories vs. Rules

[Rules](./rules.mdx) are a type of training data used by the dialogue manager for
handling pieces of conversations that should always follow the same path.

Rules can be useful when implementing:

* [One-turn interactions](./chitchat-faqs.mdx): Some messages do not require any context to answer them.
  Rules are an easy way to map intents to responses, specifying fixed answers to these messages.

* [Fallback behavior](./fallback-handoff.mdx):
  In combination with the [FallbackClassifier](./components.mdx#fallbackclassifier),
  you can write rules to respond to low-confidence user messages with a certain fallback behavior.

* [Forms](./forms.mdx): Both activating and submitting a form will often follow a fixed path.
  You can also write rules to handle [unexpected input](./unexpected-input.mdx) during a form.

Because rules do not generalize to unseen conversations, you should reserve them for
single-turn conversation snippets, and use stories to train on multi-turn
conversations.

An example of a rule where the bot returns a fixed response "utter_greet" to a user
message with intent "greet" would be:

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Greeting Rule
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

For multiple-turn interactions, you should define a story, for example:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
 - story: Greeting and ask user how they're doing
   steps:
   - intent: greet
   - action: utter_greet
   - action: utter_ask_how_doing
   - intent: doing_great
   - action: utter_happy
```




## Managing the Conversation Flow

Here are some tips for managing the conversation flow in your stories:

### When to Use Slots to Influence Conversations

Slots act as your botâ€™s memory. When you define a slot, you can define whether a
[slot](domain.mdx#slots) should influence the conversation or not.
Slots with the property `influence_conversation` set to `false` can only store
information. Slots with the property `influence_conversation` set to `true` can affect
the dialogue flow based on the information stored in it.

Slots can be set after every user message based on [slot mappings](./domain.mdx#slot-mappings).
They can also be set by a [custom action](./actions.mdx) run in response to a user message.
All slots which influence the conversation need to be added to your stories or rules.
For example, you can use a boolean slot set by a custom action to control the dialogue
flow based on its value using the following stories:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: Welcome message, premium user
  steps:
   - intent: greet
   - action: action_check_profile
   - slot_was_set:
     - premium_account: true
     - account_data: '{"id":"zpNi3JA2", "fullName":"Ada Lovelace", "accountRenewalDate":"October 3, 2021"}'
   - action: utter_welcome_premium

- story: Welcome message, basic user
  steps:
   - intent: greet
   - action: action_check_profile
   - slot_was_set:
     - premium_account: false
     - account_data: '{"id":"3JcoaEa4", "fullName":"Jack Harkness"}'
   - action: utter_welcome_basic
   - action: utter_ask_upgrade
```

In cases where you don't want a slot to affect the conversation flow, you should
set the slot's property `influence_conversation` to `false`. You do not need to
include `slot_was_set` events for slots in your stories which do not influence the
conversation.

### Implementing Branching Logic

When writing stories, sometimes the next action will depend on a value returned in one of your custom
actions. In these cases, it's important to find the right balance between returning slots and
using custom action code directly to affect what your bot does next.

In cases where a value is used only to determine the bot's response, consider embedding the
decision logic inside a custom action as opposed to using a featurized slot in your
stories. This can help reduce overall complexity and make your stories easier to manage.

For example, you can convert these stories:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: It's raining now
  steps:
  - intent: check_for_rain
  - action: action_check_for_rain
  - slot_was_set:
    - raining: true
  - action: utter_is_raining
  - action: utter_bring_umbrella

- story: It isn't raining now
  steps:
  - intent: check_for_rain
  - action: action_check_for_rain
  - slot_was_set:
    - raining: false
  - action: utter_not_raining
  - action: utter_no_umbrella_needed
```

into a single story:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: check for rain
  steps:
  - intent: check_for_rain
  - action: action_check_for_rain
```

with the custom action code:

```python
def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
	is_raining = check_rain()
	if is_raining:
		dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_is_raining")
		dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_bring_umbrella")
	else:
		dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_not_raining")
		dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_no_umbrella_needed")
	return []
```

In cases where the value is used to influence the action flow going forward,
return a featurized slot to determine the stories. For example, if you want to collect
information about new users, but not returning ones, your stories might look like this:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: greet new user
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: check_user_status
  - slot_was_set:
    - new_user: true
  - action: utter_greet
  - action: new_user_form
  - active_loop: new_user_form
  - active_loop: null

- story: greet returning user
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: check_user_status
  - slot_was_set:
    - new_user: false
  - action: utter_greet
  - action: utter_how_can_help
```


### Using OR statements and Checkpoints

[OR statements](./stories.mdx#or-statements) and [checkpoints](./stories.mdx#checkpoints)
can be useful for reducing the number of stories you have to write. However, they should
be used with caution. Overusing OR statements or checkpoints will slow down training,
and creating too many checkpoints can make your stories hard to understand.

#### OR statements

In stories where different intents or slot events are handled by your bot in the same way,
you can use OR statements as an alternative to creating a new story.

For example, you can merge these two stories:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: newsletter signup
  steps:
  - intent: signup_newsletter
  - action: utter_ask_confirm_signup
  - intent: affirm
  - action: action_signup_newsletter

- story: newsletter signup, confirm via thanks
  steps:
  - intent: signup_newsletter
  - action: utter_ask_confirm_signup
  - intent: thanks
  - action: action_signup_newsletter
```

into a single story with an OR statement:

```yaml-rasa {6-8}
stories:
- story: newsletter signup with OR
  steps:
  - intent: signup_newsletter
  - action: utter_ask_confirm_signup
  - or:
    - intent: affirm
    - intent: thanks
  - action: action_signup_newsletter
```

At training time, this story will be split into the two original stories.

:::caution consider restructuring data
If you notice that you are using OR statements frequently
in your stories, consider restructuring your intents to reduce their granularity and
more broadly capture user messages.
:::

#### Checkpoints

Checkpoints are useful for modularizing your stories into separate blocks that are
repeated often. For example, if you want your bot to ask for user feedback at the end of
each conversation flow, you can use a checkpoint to avoid having to include the feedback
interaction at the end of each story:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: beginning of conversation
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - intent: goodbye
  - action: utter_goodbye
  - checkpoint: ask_feedback

- story: user provides feedback
  steps:
  - checkpoint: ask_feedback
  - action: utter_ask_feedback
  - intent: inform
  - action: utter_thank_you
  - action: utter_anything_else

- story: user doesn't have feedback
  steps:
  - checkpoint: ask_feedback
  - action: utter_ask_feedback
  - intent: deny
  - action: utter_no_problem
  - action: utter_anything_else
```

:::warning do not overuse
Checkpoints are meant to make it easier to re-use certain sections of conversation in lots
of different stories. We highly discourage using checkpoints inside existing checkpoints,
as this increases training time significantly and makes your stories difficult to understand.
:::

### Creating Logical Breaks in Stories

When designing conversation flows, it is often tempting to create long story
examples that capture a complete conversational interaction from start to finish.
In many cases, this will increase the number of training stories required
to account for branching paths. Instead, consider separating your
longer stories into smaller conversational blocks that handle sub-tasks.

A happy path story for handling a lost credit card might look like:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: Customer loses a credit card, reviews transactions, and gets a new card
  steps:
  - intent: card_lost
  - action: check_transactions
  - slot_was_set:
    - reviewed_transactions: ["starbucks"]
  - action: utter_ask_fraudulent_transactions
  - intent: inform
  - action: action_update_transactions
  - intent: affirm
  - action: utter_confirm_transaction_dispute
  - action: utter_replace_card
  - action: mailing_address_form
  - active_loop: mailing_address
  - active_loop: null
  - action: utter_sent_replacement
  - action: utter_anything_else
  - intent: affirm
  - action: utter_help
```

Handling a lost credit card involves a series of sub-tasks, namely
checking spending history for fraudulent transactions, confirming a mailing
address for a replacement card, and then following up with the user
with any additional requests. In this conversation arc, there are
several places where the bot prompts for user input, creating
branching paths that need to be accounted for.

For example, when prompted with "utter_ask_fraudulent_transactions",
the user might respond with a "deny" intent if none are applicable.
The user might also choose to respond with a "deny" intent when asked
if there's anything else the bot can help them with.

We can separate out this long story into several smaller stories as:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: Customer loses a credit card
  steps:
  - intent: card_lost
  - action: utter_card_locked
  - action: spending_history_form
  - active_loop: spending_history_form
  - active_loop: null
  - slot_was_set:
    - reviewed_transactions: ["starbucks"]
  - action: utter_ask_fraudulent_transactions

- story: Customer reviews transactions and gets a new card
  steps:
  - action: utter_ask_fraudulent_transactions
  - intent: inform
  - action: action_update_transactions
  - slot_was_set:
    - reviewed_transactions: ["target", "starbucks"]
  - intent: affirm
  - action: utter_confirm_transaction_dispute
  - action: utter_replace_card
  - action: mailing_address_form
  - active_loop: mailing_address
  - active_loop: null
  - action: utter_sent_replacement
  - action: utter_anything_else

- story: Customer has something else they need help with
  steps:
  - action: utter_anything_else
  - intent: affirm
  - action: utter_help
```

## Handling Context Switching

Often, users will not respond with the information you ask of them and instead deviate
from the happy path with unrelated questions. Using
[CDD](./conversation-driven-development.mdx) to understand
what unhappy paths your users are taking, you can create stories for handling context
switching.


### Using Rules for Context Switching

In some cases, such as single-turn interjections, you can handle context-switching
using [rules](./rules.mdx) instead of through [stories](./stories.mdx).

Consider this conversation scenario:

<Chat caption="A single-turn interjection">
<ChatUserText>Hi, I want to pay my credit card bill</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>Can do! Which of these credit accounts do you want to make a payment towards?</ChatBotText>
<ChatBotText><p>- Credit Account A</p>
<p>- Credit Account B</p></ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>Credit account B</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>How much do you want to pay?</ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>What's my account balance?</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>Your current account balance is $1532.00</ChatBotText>
<ChatBotText>How much do you want to pay?</ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>I want to pay the minimum balance</ChatUserText>
</Chat>

In this example, the user is in the middle of paying their credit card bill, asks for
their account balance, and is then guided back into the credit card payment form.
Because asking for the account balance should always get the same response regardless of context,
you can create a rule that will automatically be triggered inside of an existing flow:

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Check my account balance
  steps:
  - intent: check_account_balance
  - action: action_get_account_balance
```


By default, the form will continue to stay active and re-prompt for the necessary
information, without having to create an additional training story.

### Using Stories for Context Switching

You'll need to write additional stories for handling context switching when the
user's interjection requires multiple conversation turns. If you have two distinct
conversational flows and want the user to be able to switch between the flows, you will
need to create stories that specify how the switching will occur and how the context
is maintained.

For example, if you want to switch context upon a user ask and then return to the
original flow after that ask is complete:

<Chat caption="A contextual interjection">
<ChatUserText>Hi, I want to pay my credit card bill</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>Can do! Which of these credit accounts do you want to make a payment towards?</ChatBotText>
<ChatBotText><p>- Credit Account A</p>
<p>- Credit Account B</p></ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>Credit account B</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>How much do you want to pay?</ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>Actually, I want to make a transfer</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>No problem!</ChatBotText>
<ChatBotText>Who would you like to transfer money to?</ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>I want to send $500 to Katy Parrow</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>Successfully transferred $500 to Katy Parrow.</ChatBotText>
<ChatBotText>Would you like to pay your credit card bill now?</ChatBotText>
</Chat>

You will need to create a story that describes this context-switching interaction:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: Context switch from credit card payment to money transfer
  steps:
  - intent: pay_credit_card
  - action: credit_card_payment_form
  - active_loop: credit_card_payment_form
  - intent: transfer_money                         # - user requests a money transfer
  - active_loop: null                              # - deactivate the credit card form
  - action: transfer_money_form                    # - switch to the money transfer form
  - active_loop: transfer_money_form
  - active_loop: null
  - action: utter_continue_credit_card_payment     # - once the money transfer is completed,
                                                   #   ask the user to return to the
                                                   #   credit card payment form
```

## Managing Conversation Data Files

You can provide training data to Rasa as
a single file or as a directory containing multiple files.
When writing stories and rules, it's usually a good idea to create separate
files based on the types of conversations being represented.

For example, you might create a file `chitchat.yml` for handling chitchat,
and a `faqs.yml` file for FAQs.
Refer to our [rasa-demo bot](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo)
for examples of story file management in complex assistants.


## Using Interactive Learning

Interactive learning makes it easy to write stories by talking to your bot and providing feedback.
This is a powerful way to explore what your bot can do, and the easiest way to fix any mistakes
it makes. One advantage of machine learning-based dialogue is that when
your bot doesn't know how to do something yet, you can just teach it!

In Rasa, you can run interactive learning in the command line with
[`rasa interactive`](./command-line-interface.mdx#rasa-interactive).

### Command-line Interactive Learning

The CLI command `rasa interactive` will start interactive learning on the command line.
If your bot has custom actions, make sure to also
[run your action server](./action-server/running-action-server.mdx) in a separate terminal window.

In interactive mode, you will be asked to confirm every intent and action prediction
before the bot proceeds. Here's an example:

```text
? Next user input:  hello

? Is the NLU classification for 'hello' with intent 'hello' correct?  Yes

------
Chat History

 #    Bot                        You
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
 1    action_listen
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
 2                                    hello
                         intent: hello 1.00
------

? The bot wants to run 'utter_greet', correct?  (Y/n)

```

You'll be able to see the conversation history and slot values at each step of the conversation.

If you type ||y|| to approve a prediction, the bot will continue. If you type ||n||, you will
be given the chance to correct the prediction before continuing: 

```text
? What is the next action of the bot?  (Use arrow keys)
 Â» <create new action>
   1.00 utter_greet
   0.00 ...
   0.00 action_back
   0.00 action_deactivate_loop
   0.00 action_default_ask_affirmation
   0.00 action_default_ask_rephrase
   0.00 action_default_fallback
   0.00 action_listen
   0.00 action_restart
   0.00 action_session_start
   0.00 action_two_stage_fallback
   0.00 utter_cheer_up
   0.00 utter_did_that_help
   0.00 utter_goodbye
   0.00 utter_happy
   0.00 utter_iamabot
```

At any point, you can use ||Ctrl-C|| to access the menu, allowing you to create more stories and export the 
data from the stories you've created so far. 

```text
? Do you want to stop?  (Use arrow keys)
 Â» Continue
   Undo Last
   Fork
   Start Fresh
   Export & Quit
```
