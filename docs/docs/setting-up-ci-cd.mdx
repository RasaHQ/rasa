description: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that iterative improvements to your assistant are tested and deployed with minimum manual effort
abstract: Even though developing a contextual assistant is different from developing traditional
  software, you should still follow software development best practices.
  Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
  pipeline ensures that incremental updates to your bot are improving it, not harming it.

## Overview

Continous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging in code changes
frequently and automatically testing changes as they are committed. Continuous
Deployment (CD) means automatically deploying integrated changes to a staging
or production environment. Together, they allow you to make more frequent improvements
to your assistant and efficiently test and deploy those changes.

This guide will cover what should go in a CI/CD pipeline, specific to a
Rasa project. How you implement that pipeline is up to you.
There are many CI/CD tools out there, such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
[GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/), and
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/). We recommend choosing a tool that integrates with
whatever Git repository you use.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The best way to improve an assistant is with frequent [incremental updates](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/fix-problems).
No matter how small a change is, you want to be sure that it doesn't introduce
new problems or negatively impact the performance of your assistant.

It is usually best to run CI checks on merge / pull requests or on commit. Most tests are
quick enough to run on every change. However, you can choose to run more
resource-intensive tests only when certain files have been changed or when some
other indicator is present. For example, if your code is hosted on Github,
you can make a test run only if the pull request has a certain label (e.g. “NLU testing required”).

### Validating Data and Stories

Data validation verifies that no mistakes or major inconsistencies appear in your domain, NLU 
data, or story data. To validate your data, have your CI run this command:

```bash
rasa data validate
```

If you pass a `max_history` value to one or more policies in your `config.yml` file, provide the 
smallest of those values as

```bash
rasa data validate --max-history <max_history>
```

If data validation results in errors, training a model can also fail or yield bad performance, so it's
always good to run this check before training a model. By including the
`--fail-on-warnings` flag, this step will fail on warnings indicating more minor issues.

:::note
Running `rasa data validate` does **not** test if your [rules](./rules.mdx) are consistent with your stories. 
However, during training, the `RulePolicy` checks for conflicts between rules and stories. Any such conflict will abort training.
:::

To read more about the validator and all of the available options, see [the documentation for 
`rasa data validate`](./command-line-interface.mdx#rasa-data-validate).

### Training a Model

You can train a model with the following command:

```bash
rasa train
```

Training a model verifies that your NLU pipeline and policy configurations are
valid and trainable, and provides a model to use for testing your assistant.
If the model passes the CI tests, then you can also [upload the trained model](./setting-up-ci-cd.mdx#deploying-your-rasa-model)
to your server as part of the continuous deployment process.


### Testing Your Assistant

Testing your trained model on [test stories](./testing-your-assistant.mdx#writing-test-stories) is the best way to have confidence in how your assistant
will act in certain situations. Written in a modified story
format, test stories allow you to provide entire conversations and test that, given certain
user input, your model will behave in the expected manner. This is especially
important as you start introducing more complicated stories from user
conversations.

The command to run test stories is:

```bash
rasa test --fail-on-prediction-errors
```
By default, the command will run tests on stories from any files with names starting with `test_`. You can also provide
a specific test stories file or directory with the `--stories` argument.

The `--fail-on-prediction-errors` flag ensures the test will fail if any test
story fails.

End-to-end conversation testing is only as thorough and accurate as the test
cases you include, so you should continue to grow your set of test stories
as you make improvements to your assistant. A good rule of thumb to follow is that you should aim for your test stories
to be representative of the true distribution of real conversations.
Rasa X makes it easy to [add test conversations based on real conversations](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/test-assistant/#how-to-create-tests).

:::note
Running test stories does **not** execute your action code. You will need to
[test your action code](./setting-up-ci-cd.mdx#testing-action-code) in a separate step.
:::

### Comparing NLU Performance

If you've made significant changes to your NLU training data (e.g.
splitting an intent into two intents or adding a lot of training examples), you should run a
[full NLU evaluation](./testing-your-assistant.mdx#evaluating-an-nlu-model). You'll want to compare
the performance of the NLU model without your changes to an NLU model with your
changes.

You can do this by running NLU testing in cross-validation mode:

```bash
rasa test nlu --cross-validation
```

You could also train a model on a training set and testing it on a test set. If you use the train-test
set approach, it is best to [shuffle and split your data](./command-line-interface.mdx#rasa-data-split) using `rasa data split` as part of this CI step, as
opposed to using a static NLU test set, which can easily become outdated.

Because this test doesn't result in a pass/fail exit code, it's best to make
the results visible so that you can interpret them.
For example, [this GitHub Actions Workflow](https://gist.github.com/amn41/de555c93913a01fbd56df2e2d211862c)
includes commenting on a PR with a results table that shows which intents are confused with others.

Since NLU comparison can be a fairly resource intensive test, you may choose to run this test
only when certain conditions are met. Conditions might include the presence of a manual label (e.g. “NLU
testing required”), changes to NLU data, or changes to the NLU pipeline.

### Testing Action Code

The approach used to test your action code will depend on how it is
implemented. For example, if you connect to external APIs, you should write integration tests to ensure
that those APIs respond as expected to common inputs. However you test your action code, you should
include these tests in your CI pipeline so that they run each time you make changes.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

To get improvements out to your users frequently, you will want to automate as
much of the deployment process as possible.

CD steps usually run on push or merge to a certain branch, once CI checks have
succeeded.

### Deploying Your Rasa Model

If you ran [test stories](#testing-your-assistant) in your CI pipeline,
you'll already have a trained model. You can set up your CD pipeline to upload the trained model to your
Rasa server if the CI results are satisfactory. For example, to upload a model to Rasa X:

```bash
curl -k -F "model=@models/my_model.tar.gz" "https://example.rasa.com/api/projects/default/models?api_token={your_api_token}"
```

If you are using Rasa X, you can also [tag the uploaded model](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/pages/http-api/#tag/Models/paths/~1projects~1{project_id}~1models~1{model}~1tags~1{tag}/put)
as production (or whichever deployment you want to tag if using multiple [deployment environments](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/enterprise/deployment-environments/#)):

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://example.rasa.com/api/projects/default/models/my_model/tags/production"
```

:::caution updates to action code
If your update includes changes to both your model and your action
code, and these changes depend on each other in any way, you should **not**
automatically tag the model as `production`. You will first need to build and
deploy your updated action server, so that the new model won't e.g. call
actions that don't exist in the pre-update action server.
:::

### Deploying Your Action Server

You can automate
[building and uploading a new image for your action server](./how-to-deploy.mdx#building-an-action-server-image)
to an image repository for each
update to your action code. As noted above, be careful with
automatically deploying a new image tag to production if the action server
would be incompatible with the current production model.

## Example CI/CD pipelines

As examples, see the CI/CD pipelines for
[Sara](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml),
the Rasa assistant that you can talk to in the Rasa Docs, and
[Carbon Bot](https://github.com/RasaHQ/carbon-bot/blob/master/.github/workflows/model_ci.yml).
Both use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as a CI/CD tool.

These examples are just two of many possibilities. If you have a CI/CD setup you like, please
share it with the Rasa community on the [forum](https://forum.rasa.com).
