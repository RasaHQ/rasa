## Running the Action Server

Because `rasa` is not a dependency of `rasa-sdk`, you can run the action
server without installing `rasa`. There are two ways to run the action server
depending on how you have it installed:

If you have `rasa` installed, run this command to start your action server:

```bash
rasa run actions
```

Otherwise, if you do not have `rasa` installed, run this command:

```bash
python -m rasa_sdk --actions actions
```

The file that contains your custom actions should be called `actions.py`.
Alternatively, you can use a package directory called `actions` or else
manually specify an actions module or package with the `--actions` flag.

The full list of options for running the action server with either command is:

```text [rasa run actions --help]
```
