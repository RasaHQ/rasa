description: Follow a rule-based process of information gathering using FormActions in open source bot framework Rasa.
---

One of the most common conversation patterns is to collect a few pieces of
information from a user in order to do something (book a restaurant, call an
API, search a database, etc.). This is also called **slot filling**.

## Usage

To use forms with Rasa Open Source you need to make sure that the
[RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) is added to your policy configuration.
For example:

```yaml
policies:
- ... # other policies
- name: RulePolicy
```

### Defining a Form

Define a form by adding it to the `forms` section in your [Domain](./domains.mdx).
The name of the form is also the name of the action which you can use in
[Stories](./stories.mdx) or [Rules](./rules.mdx) to handle form executions. Further you
need to define [Slot Mappings](./forms.mdx#form-slot-mappings) for each slot which your
form should fill.
You can specify one or more slot mappings for each slot to be filled.

The following example of a form `your_form` will fill only one slot
`age` from an extracted entity `age`.

```yaml
forms:
  your_form:
    age:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: age
```

Once the form action gets called for the first time, the form gets activated and it will
start asking the user for the next slot which is not yet filled. It does this by
looking for a [response](./responses.mdx) called
`utter_ask_{slot_name}`. Make sure to define these responses in your domain file for
each required slot.

### Activating a Form

To activate a form you need to add a [Stories](./stories.mdx) or [Rules](./rules.mdx)
which describes when the assistant should run the form. In case a certain intent
triggers a form you can for example use the following rule:

```yaml
- rule: Activate form
  steps:
  - ...
  - intent: intent_which_activates_form
  - action: your_form
  - form: your_form
```

:::note
The `form: your_form` step indicates that the form should be activated after
``your_form`` was run.
:::

### Deactivating a Form

A form will automatically deactivate itself once all required slots are filled.
You can describe your assistant's behavior for the end of a form with a rule or a story.
If you don't add an applicable story or rule, the assistant will listen for the next
user message after the form is finished.
The following example runs the utterance `utter_all_slots_filled` as soon as the form
`your_form` filled all required slots.

```yaml
- rule: Submit form
  steps:
  # Condition that form is active.
  - form: your_form
  - ...
  # Condition that form was deactivated
  - action: your_form
  - form: null
  - slot: requested_slot
    value: null
  # The action we want to run when the form is submitted.
  - action: utter_all_slots_filled
```

Users might want to break out of a form early. Please see
[Writing Stories / Rules for Unhappy Form Paths](./forms.mdx#section-unhappy) how to
write stories or rules for this case.

### Slot Mappings

Rasa Open Source comes with four predefined functions to fill the slots of a form
based on the latest user message. Please see
[Custom Slot Mappings](./forms.mdx#custom-slot-mappings) if you need a custom function
to extract the required information.

#### from_entity

The `from_entity` mapping fills slots based on extracted entities.
It will look for an entity called entity_name` to fill a slot `slot_name`
regardless of user intent if `intent_name` is None` else only if the users intent
is `intent_name`. If `role_name` and/or `group_name` are provided, the role/group
label of the entity also needs to match the given values. The slot mapping will not
apply if the intent of the message is `excluded_intent`. Note that you can
also define lists of intents for the parameters `intent` and `not_intent`.

```yaml
forms:
  your_form:
    slot_name:
    - type: from_entity
      entity: entity_name
      role: role_name
      group: group name
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

#### from_text

The `from_text` mapping will use the text of the next user utterance to fill the slot
`slot_name` regardless of user intent if `intent_name` is `None` else only if
user intent is `intent_name`. The slot mapping will not
apply if the intent of the message is `excluded_intent`. Note that you can
also define lists of intents for the parameters `intent` and `not_intent`.

```yaml
forms:
  your_form:
    slot_name:
    - type: from_text
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

#### from_intent

The `from_intent` mapping will fill slot `slot_name` with value `my_value` if
user intent is `intent_name` or `None`. The slot mapping will not
apply if the intent of the message is `excluded_intent`. Note that you can
also define lists of intents for the parameters `intent` and `not_intent`.

:::note
The slot mapping will not apply during the initial activation of the form. To fill
a slot based on the intent which activated the form use the ``from_trigger_intent``
mapping
:::

```yaml
forms:
  your_form:
    slot_name:
    - type: from_intent
      value: my_value
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

#### from_trigger_intent

The `from_trigger_intent` mapping will fill slot `slot_name` with value `my_value`
if the form was activated by a user message with intent `intent_name`.
The slot mapping will not apply if the intent of the message is
`excluded_intent`. Note that you can
also define lists of intents for the parameters `intent` and `not_intent`.

```yaml
forms:
  your_form:
    slot_name:
    - type: from_trigger_intent
      value: my_value
      intent: intent_name
      not_intent: excluded_intent
```

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="section-unhappy"></a>

### Writing Stories / Rules for Unhappy Form Paths

Your users will not always respond with the information you ask of them.
Typically, users will ask questions, make chitchat, change their mind, or otherwise
stray from the happy path. The way this works with forms is that a form will raise
an `ActionExecutionRejection` if the user didn't provide the requested information.
You need to handle events that might cause `ActionExecutionRejection` errors
with rules or stories. For example, if you expect your users to chitchat with your bot,
you could add a story like this:

```yaml
- rule: Example of an unhappy path
  steps:
  # Condition that form is active.
  - form: your_form
  - ...
  # This unhappy path handles the case of an intent `chitchat`.
  - intent: chitchat
  - action: utter_chitchat
  # Return to form after handling the `chitchat` intent
  - action: your_form
  - form: your_form
```

In some situations, users may change their mind in the middle of the form action
and decide not to go forward with their initial request. In cases like this, the
assistant should stop asking for the requested slots. You can handle such situations
gracefully using a default action `action_deactivate_form` which will deactivate
the form and reset the requested slot. An example story of such conversation could
look as follows:

```yaml
- rule: Example of an unhappy path
  steps:
  # Condition that form is active.
  - form: your_form
  - ...
  - intent: stop
  - action: utter_ask_continue
  - intent: stop
  - action: action_deactivate_form
  - form: null
```

It is **strongly** recommended that you build these rules or stories using interactive
learning. If you write these rules / stories by hand you will likely miss important
things. Please read
[Interactive Learning with Forms](./interactive-learning.mdx#section-interactive-learning-forms)
on how to use interactive learning with forms.

## Advanced Usage

Forms are fully customizable using [Custom Actions](./actions.mdx#custom-actions).

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="form-validation"></a>

### Validating Form input

After extracting a slot value from user input, you can validate the extracted slots.
By default Rasa Open Source only validates if any slot was filled after requesting
a slot. If nothing is extracted from the user’s utterance for any of the required slots,
an `ActionExecutionRejection` error will be raised, meaning the action execution was
rejected and therefore Rasa Open Source will fall back onto a different policy to
predict another action.

You can implement a [Custom Action](./actions.mdx#custom-actions) `validate_{form_name}`
to validate any extracted slots. Make sure to add this action to the `actions`
section of your domain:

```yaml
actions:
- ... # other actions
- validate_your_form
```

When the form is executed it will run your custom action. In your custom action
you can either

- validate already extracted slots. You can retrieve them from the tracker by running
  `tracker.get_extracted_slots`.
- use [Custom Slot Mappings](./forms.mdx#form-slot-mappings) to extract slot values .

After validating the extracted slots, return `SlotSet` events for them. If you want
to mark a slot as invalid return a `SlotSet` event which sets the value to `None`.
Note that if you don't return a `SlotSet` for an extracted slot, Rasa Open Source
will assume that the value is valid.

The following example shows the implementation of a custom action
which validates that every extracted slot is valid.

```python
from typing import Dict, Text, List, Any

from rasa_sdk import Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import EventType
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet


class ValidateSlots(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "validate_your_form"

    def run(
        self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict
    ) -> List[EventType]:
        extracted_slots: Dict[Text, Any] = tracker.get_extracted_slots()

        validation_events = []

        for slot_name, slot_value in extracted_slots:
            # Check if slot is valid.
            if is_valid(slot_value):
                validation_events.append(SlotSet(slot_name, slot_value))
            else:
                # Return a `SlotSet` event with value `None` to indicate that this
                # slot still needs to be filled.
                validation_events.append(SlotSet(slot_name, None))

        return validation_events

    def is_valid(slot_value: Any) -> bool:
        # Implementation of the validate function.
```

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="custom-slot-mappings"></a>

### Custom Slot Mappings

If none of the predefined [Slot Mappings](./forms.mdx#form-slot-mappings) fit your use
case, you can use the
[Custom Action](./actions.mdx#custom-actions) `validate_{form_name}` to write your own
extraction code. Rasa Open Source will trigger this function when the form is run.

Make sure your custom action returns `SlotSet` events for every extracted value.
The following example shows the implementation of a custom slot mapping which sets
a slot based on the length of the last user message.

```python
from typing import Dict, Text, List

from rasa_sdk import Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import EventType
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet


class ValidateSlots(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "validate_your_form"

    def run(
        self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict
    ) -> List[EventType]:
        text_of_last_user_message = tracker.latest_message.get("text")

        return [SlotSet("user_message_length", len(text_of_last_user_message))]
```

### Requesting Extra Slots

If you have frequent changes to the required slots and don't want to retrain your
assistant when your form changes, you can also use a
[Custom Action](./actions.mdx#custom-actions) `validate_{form_name}` to define
which slots should be requested. Rasa Open Source will run your custom action whenever
the form validates user input. Set the slot `requested_slot` to the name of the slot
which should be extracted next. If all desired slots are filled, set `requested_slot`
to `None`.

The following example shows the implementation of a custom action which requests
the three slots `last_name`, `first_name`, and `city`.

```python
from typing import Dict, Text, List

from rasa_sdk import Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import EventType
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet


class ValidateSlots(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "validate_your_form"

    def run(
        self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict
    ) -> List[EventType]:
        required_slots = ["last name", "first_name", "city"]

        for slot_name in required_slots:
            if tracker.slots.get(slot_name) is None:
                # The slot is not filled yet. Request the user to fill this slot next.
                return [SlotSet("requested_slot", slot_name)]

        # All slots are filled.
        return [SlotSet("requested_slot", None)]
```

### The requested_slot slot

The slot `requested_slot` is automatically added to the domain as an
unfeaturized slot. If you want to make it featurized, you need to add it
to your domain file as a categorical slot. You might want to do this if you
want to handle your unhappy paths differently depending on what slot is
currently being asked from the user. For example, say your users respond
to one of the bot's questions with another question, like *why do you need to know that?*
The response to this `explain` intent depends on where we are in the story.
In the restaurant case, your stories would look something like this:

```story
## explain cuisine slot
* request_restaurant
    - restaurant_form
    - form{"name": "restaurant_form"}
    - slot{"requested_slot": "cuisine"}
* explain
    - utter_explain_cuisine
    - restaurant_form
    - slot{"cuisine": "greek"}
    ( ... all other slots the form set ... )
    - form{"name": null}

## explain num_people slot
* request_restaurant
    - restaurant_form
    - form{"name": "restaurant_form"}
    - slot{"requested_slot": "num_people"}
* explain
    - utter_explain_num_people
    - restaurant_form
    - slot{"cuisine": "greek"}
    ( ... all other slots the form set ... )
    - form{"name": null}
```

Again, it is **strongly** recommended that you use interactive
learning to build these stories.
Please read [Interactive Learning with Forms](./interactive-learning.mdx#section-interactive-learning-forms)
on how to use interactive learning with forms.

### Using a Custom Action to Ask For the Next Slot

As soon as the form determined which slot has to be filled next by the user, it will
execute the action `utter_ask_{slot_name}` to ask the user to provide the necessary
input. If a regular utterance is not enough, you can also provide a custom action
`action_ask_{slot_name}` to ask for the next slot.

```python
from typing import Dict, Text, List

from rasa_sdk import Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import EventType
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk import Action


class AskForSlotAction(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_ask_age"

    def run(
        self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict
    ) -> List[EventType]:
        dispatcher.utter_message(text="How old are you?")
        return []
```

## Debugging

The first thing to try is to run your bot with the `--debug` flag, see
[Command Line Interface](../user-guide/command-line-interface.mdx) for details.
If you are just getting started, you probably only have a few hand-written stories.
This is a great starting point, but
you should give your bot to people to test **as soon as possible**. One of the guiding principles
behind Rasa Core is:

> Learning from real conversations is more important than designing hypothetical ones

So don't try to cover every possibility in your hand-written stories before giving it to testers.
Real user behavior will always surprise you!
