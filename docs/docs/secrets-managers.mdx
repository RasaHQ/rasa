Rasa Pro supports the following secrets managers:
* [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault)


Currently, Rasa Pro supports safeguarding credentials for the following services:
- [Tracker Stores](./tracker-stores.mdx)


## HashiCorp Vault Secrets Manager

Use Vault Secrets Manager to store credentials used to authenticate access to external services.
The credentials are stored in a Vault instance and can be encrypted at rest.
To store credentials in a Vault instance, you can read the official Vault docs
[Storing secrets in Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-first-secret).

You can also encrypt credentials at rest with
[Vault Transit Engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit).

:::note
Expiring tokens need to be renewed periodically, and the renewal process is done over the network,
Rasa Pro will try to renew the token 15 seconds before it expires.
If the token's time-to-live (TTL) is less than 15 seconds, we will try to renew it after 1 second,
but it might fail due to network latency.

Rasa Pro has a built-in retry mechanism for renewing the token.

If the token is not renewed successfully it will be considered expired
and Rasa Pro will not be able to access the secrets.
You will need to create a new renewable token and restart Rasa Pro with new token.
:::


### Authentication
Rasa Pro can authenticate to Vault through
[Token authentication](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token).

Both `expiring` and `non-expiring` (so called, root tokens) tokens are supported.
Rasa Pro will automatically renew the token if it is expiring.


### How to configure access to Vault

Access to Vault secrets manager can be configured with environment variables
and through `endpoints.yml` configuration file.

Environment variables and `endpoints.yml` configuration file are merged together
and *the values from the environment variables take precedence*.

The following environment variables are available:

| Environment Variable          | Description                                                                                    | Default               |
|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `SECRET_MANAGER`              | **Required**. The secrets manager to use. *Currently only "vault" is supported*                | `vault`               |
| `VAULT_HOST`                  | **Required**. The address of the vault server                                                  |                       |
| `VAULT_TOKEN`                 | **Required**. token to authenticate to the vault server                                        |                       |
| `VAULT_RASA_SECRETS_PATH`     | Path to the secrets in the vault server                                                        | `rasa-secrets`        |
| `VAULT_TRANSIT_MOUNT_POINT`   | If transit secrets engine is enabled, set this to mount point of the transit engine            |                       |

To configure the Vault secrets manager, you can fill the following section in `endpoints.yml` file:
```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml
secrets_manager:
    type: vault # required - the secrets manager to use
    token: <token used to authenticate to Vault> # requ1ired - token to authenticate to the vault server
    url: "http://localhost:1234" # required - the address of the vault server
    secrets_path: rasa-secrets  # path to the secrets in the vault server if not set it defaults to `rasa-secrets`
    transit_mount_point: transit # if transit secrets engine is enabled, set this to mount point of the transit engine
```

#### Store access credentials in environment variables
A simple example on how to combine environment variables and `endpoints.yml` configuration file
would be to store access token in the environment variable and the rest of the configuration
in the `endpoints.yml` file.

```bash
# environment variables
VAULT_TOKEN=<token used to authenticate to Vault>
```


```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml
secrets_manager:
    type: vault
    url: "http://localhost:1234"
    secrets_path: rasa-secrets  # if not set it defaults to `rasa-secrets`
    transit_mount_point: transit # if you have enabled transit secrets engine, and you want to use it
```

### How to configure Tracker Store with Vault Secrets Manager
1. Configure Rasa to access the Vault instance

    Checkout the [How to configure access to Vault](#how-to-configure-access-to-vault) section for more details.

2. Configure Rasa to use the Vault secrets manager to fetch credentials for the tracker store
    ```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml
    tracker_store:
          type: SQL
          url: localhost:5432
          username:
                source: secrets_manager.vault
                secret_key: sql_store_username
          password:
                source: secrets_manager.vault
                secret_key: sql_store_password
    ```


### Example
This is a simple example which demonstrates how to store credentials for the Tracker store in Vault,
how to access them from Rasa and how to update credentials without restarting Rasa.

1. Start Vault instance
    ```bash
    docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK --name=vault -p 1234:1234 -p 8200:8200 -e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=myroot' -e 'VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:1234' -d vault
    ```

2. Store credentials for tracker store in Vault
    ```bash
    # go inside Vault container
    docker exec -it vault sh

    # (optional) if you get access denied error
    export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:1234
    export VAULT_TOKEN=myroot

    # store secret in the Vault under the group rasa-secrets
    vault kv put -mount=secret rasa-secrets sql_store_username=postgres sql_store_password=12345
    ```

3. Start Postgres container
    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=rasa -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=12345 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
    ```

4. [Configure tracker store with vault secrets manager](#how-to-configure-tracker-store-with-vault-secrets-manager)
5. Start Rasa
6. Chat with the bot
7. Update credentials for the tracker store in Vault
    ```bash
    # go inside Vault container
    docker exec -it vault sh

    # (optional) if you get access denied error
    export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:1234
    export VAULT_TOKEN=myroot

    vault kv put -mount=secret rasa-secrets sql_store_username=postgres sql_store_password=1234567
    ```
8. Update credentials for postgres
    ```bash
    # go inside postgres container
    docker exec -it postgres bash
    # change user to postgres
    su postgres
    # drop all connections to the database rasa
    psql -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'rasa' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();"

    # change password for user postgres
    psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD '1234567';"
    ```

9. Chat with the bot again

    You can observe that the bot is still able to access the tracker store even though the credentials have changed.
    Rasa was able to fetch the new credentials from Vault and to reconnect to the tracker store without the need to
    restart Rasa.
