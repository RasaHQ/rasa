## How to Choose a Pipeline

In Rasa Open Source, incoming messages are processed by a sequence of components.
These components are executed one after another in a so-called processing `pipeline` defined in your `config.yml`.
Choosing an NLU pipeline allows you to customize your model and finetune it on your dataset.

### Sensible Starting Pipelines

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="recommended-pipeline-english"></a>

We recommend using following pipeline, if your training data is in English:

```yaml (docs/sources/data/configs_for_docs/default_english_config.yml)
```

The pipeline contains the [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components#convertfeaturizer) that provides pre-trained word embeddings of the user utterance.
Pre-trained word embeddings are helpful as they already encode some kind of linguistic knowledge.
For example, if you have a sentence like “I want to buy apples” in your training data, and Rasa is asked to predict
the intent for “get pears”, your model already knows that the words “apples” and “pears” are very similar.
This is especially useful if you don’t have enough training data.
The advantage of the [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components#convertfeaturizer) is that it doesn’t treat each word of the user message independently, but
creates a contextual vector representation for the complete sentence.
However, `ConveRT` is only available in English.

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="recommended-pipeline-pretrained-non-english"></a>

If your training data is not in English, but you still want to use pre-trained word embeddings, we recommend using
the following pipeline:

```yaml (docs/sources/data/configs_for_docs/default_spacy_config.yml)
```

It uses the [SpacyFeaturizer](./components#spacyfeaturizer) instead of the [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components#convertfeaturizer).
[SpacyFeaturizer](./components#spacyfeaturizer) provides pre-trained word embeddings from either GloVe or fastText in many different languages
(see [Pre-trained Word Vectors](./language-support#pretrained-word-vectors)).

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="recommended-pipeline-non-english"></a>

If you don’t use any pre-trained word embeddings inside your pipeline, you are not bound to a specific language
and can train your model to be more domain specific.
If there are no word embeddings for your language or you have very domain specific terminology,
we recommend using the following pipeline:

```yaml (docs/sources/data/configs_for_docs/default_config.yml)
```

:::note
We encourage everyone to define their own pipeline by listing the names of the components you want to use.
You can find the details of each component in [Components](./components).
If you want to use custom components in your pipeline, see [Custom NLU Components](../api/custom-nlu-components).

:::


### Component Lifecycle

Each component processes an input and/or creates an output. The order of the components is determined by
the order they are listed in the `config.yml`; the output of a component can be used by any other component that
comes after it in the pipeline. Some components only produce information used by other components
in the pipeline. Other components produce `output` attributes that are returned after
the processing has finished.

For example, for the sentence `"I am looking for Chinese food"`, the output is:

```json
{
    "text": "I am looking for Chinese food",
    "entities": [
        {
            "start": 8,
            "end": 15,
            "value": "chinese",
            "entity": "cuisine",
            "extractor": "DIETClassifier",
            "confidence": 0.864
        }
    ],
    "intent": {"confidence": 0.6485910906220309, "name": "restaurant_search"},
    "intent_ranking": [
        {"confidence": 0.6485910906220309, "name": "restaurant_search"},
        {"confidence": 0.1416153159565678, "name": "affirm"}
    ]
}
```

This is created as a combination of the results of the different components in the following pipeline:

```yaml
pipeline:
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
  - name: RegexFeaturizer
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
    analyzer: "char_wb"
    min_ngram: 1
    max_ngram: 4
  - name: DIETClassifier
  - name: EntitySynonymMapper
  - name: ResponseSelector
```

For example, the `entities` attribute here is created by the `DIETClassifier` component.

Every component can implement several methods from the `Component` base class; in a pipeline these different methods
will be called in a specific order. Assuming we added the following pipeline to our `config.yml`:

```yaml
pipeline:
  - name: "Component A"
  - name: "Component B"
  - name: "Last Component"
```

The image below shows the call order during the training of this pipeline:



<img alt="image" src="../../img/component_lifecycle.png" />

Before the first component is created using the `create` function, a so
called `context` is created (which is nothing more than a python dict).
This context is used to pass information between the components. For example,
one component can calculate feature vectors for the training data, store
that within the context and another component can retrieve these feature
vectors from the context and do intent classification.

Initially the context is filled with all configuration values. The arrows
in the image show the call order and visualize the path of the passed
context. After all components are trained and persisted, the
final context dictionary is used to persist the model’s metadata.

### Choosing the Right Components

There are components for entity extraction, for intent classification, response selection,
pre-processing, and others. You can learn more about any specific component on the [Components](./components) page.
If you want to add your own component, for example to run a spell-check or to
do sentiment analysis, check out [Custom NLU Components](../api/custom-nlu-components).

A pipeline usually consists of three main parts:

#### Tokenization

For tokenization of English input, we recommend the [ConveRTTokenizer](./components#converttokenizer).
You can process other whitespace-tokenized (words are separated by spaces) languages
with the [WhitespaceTokenizer](./components#whitespacetokenizer). If your language is not whitespace-tokenized, you should use a different tokenizer.
We support a number of different [tokenizers](./components#tokenizers), or you can
create your own [custom tokenizer](../api/custom-nlu-components).

:::note
Some components further down the pipeline may require a specific tokenizer. You can find those requirements
on the individual components in [Components](./components). If a required component is missing inside the pipeline, an
error will be thrown.

:::

#### Featurization

You need to decide whether to use components that provide pre-trained word embeddings or not. We recommend in cases
of small amounts of training data to start with pre-trained word embeddings. Once you have a larger amount of data
and ensure that most relevant words will be in your data and therefore will have a word embedding, supervised
embeddings, which learn word meanings directly from your training data, can make your model more specific to your domain.
If you can’t find a pre-trained model for your language, you should use supervised embeddings.

##### Pre-trained Embeddings

The advantage of using pre-trained word embeddings in your pipeline is that if you have a training example like:
“I want to buy apples”, and Rasa is asked to predict the intent for “get pears”, your model already knows that the
words “apples” and “pears” are very similar. This is especially useful if you don’t have enough training data.
We support a few components that provide pre-trained word embeddings:

1. [MitieFeaturizer](./components#mitiefeaturizer)

2. [SpacyFeaturizer](./components#spacyfeaturizer)

3. [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components#convertfeaturizer)

4. [LanguageModelFeaturizer](./components#languagemodelfeaturizer)

If your training data is in English, we recommend using the [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components#convertfeaturizer).
The advantage of the [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components#convertfeaturizer) is that it doesn’t treat each word of the user message independently, but
creates a contextual vector representation for the complete sentence. For example, if you
have a training example, like: “Can I book a car?”, and Rasa is asked to predict the intent for “I need a ride from
my place”, since the contextual vector representation for both examples are already very similar, the intent classified
for both is highly likely to be the same. This is also useful if you don’t have enough training data.

An alternative to [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components#convertfeaturizer) is the [LanguageModelFeaturizer](./components#languagemodelfeaturizer) which uses pre-trained language
models such as BERT, GPT-2, etc. to extract similar contextual vector representations for the complete sentence. See
[HFTransformersNLP](./components#hftransformersnlp) for a full list of supported language models.

If your training data is not in English you can also use a different variant of a language model which
is pre-trained in the language specific to your training data.
For example, there are chinese (`bert-base-chinese`) and japanese (`bert-base-japanese`) variants of the BERT model.
A full list of different variants of
these language models is available in the
[official documentation of the Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html).

[SpacyFeaturizer](./components#spacyfeaturizer) also provides word embeddings in many different languages (see [Pre-trained Word Vectors](./language-support#pretrained-word-vectors)),
so you can use this as another alternative, depending on the language of your training data.

##### Supervised Embeddings

If you don’t use any pre-trained word embeddings inside your pipeline, you are not bound to a specific language
and can train your model to be more domain specific. For example, in general English, the word “balance” is closely
related to “symmetry”, but very different to the word “cash”. In a banking domain, “balance” and “cash” are closely
related and you’d like your model to capture that.
You should only use featurizers from the category [sparse featurizers](./components#text-featurizers), such as
[CountVectorsFeaturizer](./components#countvectorsfeaturizer), [RegexFeaturizer](./components#regexfeaturizer) or [LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer](./components#lexicalsyntacticfeaturizer), if you don’t want to use
pre-trained word embeddings.

#### Entity Recognition / Intent Classification / Response Selectors

Depending on your data you may want to only perform intent classification, entity recognition or response selection.
Or you might want to combine multiple of those tasks.
We support several components for each of the tasks. All of them are listed in [Components](./components).
We recommend using [DIETClassifier](./components#diet-classifier) for intent classification and entity recognition
and [ResponseSelector](./components#response-selector) for response selection.

By default all of these components consume all available features produced in the pipeline.
However, sometimes it makes sense to restrict the features that are used by a specific component.
For example, [ResponseSelector](./components#response-selector) is likely to perform better if no features from the
[RegexFeaturizer](./components#regexfeaturizer) or [LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer](./components#lexicalsyntacticfeaturizer) are used.
To achieve that, you can do the following:
Set an alias for every featurizer in your pipeline via the option `alias`.
By default the alias is set the the full featurizer class name, for example, `RegexFeaturizer`.
You can then specify, for example, on the [ResponseSelector](./components#response-selector) via the option `featurizers` what features from
which featurizers should be used.
If you don’t set the option `featurizers` all available features will be used.
To check which components have the option `featurizers` available, see [Components](./components).

Here is an example configuration file where the `DIETClassifier` is using all available features and the
`ResponseSelector` is just using the features from the `ConveRTFeaturizer` and the `CountVectorsFeaturizer`.

```yaml (docs/sources/data/configs_for_docs/config_featurizers.yml)
```

### Multi-Intent Classification

You can use Rasa Open Source components to split intents into multiple labels. For example, you can predict
multiple intents (`thank+goodbye`) or model hierarchical intent structure (`feedback+positive` being more similar
to `feedback+negative` than `chitchat`).
To do this, you need to use the [DIETClassifier](./components#diet-classifier) in your pipeline.
You’ll also need to define these flags in whichever tokenizer you are using:

* `intent_tokenization_flag`: Set it to `True`, so that intent labels are tokenized.

* `intent_split_symbol`: Set it to the delimiter string that splits the intent labels. In this case `+`, default `_`.

Read a [tutorial](https://blog.rasa.com/how-to-handle-multiple-intents-per-input-using-rasa-nlu-tensorflow-pipeline/)
on how to use multiple intents in Rasa.

Here’s an example configuration:

```yaml
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_tokenization_flag: True
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
```

### Comparing Pipelines

Rasa gives you the tools to compare the performance of multiple pipelines on your data directly.
See [Comparing NLU Pipelines](../user-guide/testing-your-assistant#comparing-nlu-pipelines) for more information.

:::note
Intent classification is independent of entity extraction. So sometimes
NLU will get the intent right but entities wrong, or the other way around.
You need to provide enough data for both intents and entities.

:::

## Handling Class Imbalance

Classification algorithms often do not perform well if there is a large class imbalance,
for example if you have a lot of training data for some intents and very little training data for others.
To mitigate this problem, you can use a `balanced` batching strategy.
This algorithm ensures that all classes are represented in every batch, or at least in
as many subsequent batches as possible, still mimicking the fact that some classes are more frequent than others.
Balanced batching is used by default. In order to turn it off and use a classic batching strategy include
`batch_strategy: sequence` in your config file.

```yaml
language: "en"

pipeline:
# - ... other components
- name: "DIETClassifier"
  batch_strategy: sequence
```

## Configuring Tensorflow

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="configuring-tensorflow"></a>

TensorFlow allows configuring options in the runtime environment via
[TF Config submodule](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config). Rasa Open Source supports a smaller subset of these
configuration options and makes appropriate calls to the `tf.config` submodule.
This smaller subset comprises of configurations that developers frequently use with Rasa Open Source.
All configuration options are specified using environment variables as shown in subsequent sections.

### Optimizing CPU Performance

:::note
We recommend that you configure these options only if you are an advanced TensorFlow user and understand the
implementation of the machine learning components in your pipeline. These options affect how operations are carried
out under the hood in Tensorflow. Leaving them at their default values is fine.

:::

Depending on the TensorFlow operations a NLU component or Core policy uses, you can leverage multi-core CPU
parallelism by tuning these options.

#### Parallelizing One Operation

Set `TF_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS` as an environment variable to specify the maximum number of threads that can be used
to parallelize the execution of one operation. For example, operations like `tf.matmul()` and `tf.reduce_sum` can be executed
on multiple threads running in parallel. The default value for this variable is `0` which means TensorFlow would
allocate one thread per CPU core.

#### Parallelizing Multiple Operations

Set `TF_INTER_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS` as an environment variable to specify the maximum number of threads that can be used
to parallelize the execution of multiple **non-blocking** operations. These would include operations that do not have a
directed path between them in the TensorFlow graph. In other words, the computation of one operation does not affect the
computation of the other operation. The default value for this variable is `0` which means TensorFlow would allocate one thread per CPU core.

To understand more about how these two options differ from each other, refer to this
[stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41233635/meaning-of-inter-op-parallelism-threads-and-intra-op-parallelism-threads/41233901#41233901).

### Optimizing GPU Performance

#### Limiting GPU Memory Growth

TensorFlow by default blocks all the available GPU memory for the running process. This can be limiting if you are running
multiple TensorFlow processes and want to distribute memory across them. To prevent Rasa Open Source from blocking all
of the available GPU memory, set the environment variable `TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH` to `True`.

#### Restricting Absolute GPU Memory Available

You may want to limit the absolute amount of GPU memory that can be used by a Rasa Open Source process.

For example, say you have two visible GPUs(`GPU:0` and `GPU:1`) and you want to allocate 1024 MB from the first GPU
and 2048 MB from the second GPU. You can do this by setting the environment variable `TF_GPU_MEMORY_ALLOC` to `"0:1024, 1:2048"`.
