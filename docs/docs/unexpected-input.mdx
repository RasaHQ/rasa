title: Handling Unexpected Input
abstract: One thing you can count on when building a conversational assistant is that users
will say unexpected things. This page is a guide on handling unexpected input.
---

Unexpected input is a deviation from the [happy path](glossary.mdx#happy_unhappy_paths)
that you have defined.  For example:

- A user walks away in the middle of a conversation about their subscription, then comes back
and says "hi!"
- A user asks "Why do you need to know that?" when the bot asks for their email address.

This page is a guide on methods for handling unexpected input that is still within your bot's domain.
Depending on what kind of unexpected
input you're trying to handle, some or all of the methods describe may be applicable for you. This guide
is not about disambiguating user input or handling out-of-scope questions; for these cases see
the guide on [fallback and human handoff](fallback-handoff.mdx)


## User Interjections

There are two kinds of unexpected input: generic interjections, and contextual interjections.
Generic interjections are interruptions that should always get the same response regardless of the
conversation context. If you already have a rule defining the response to an intent, you don't
need to do anything else to handle it as an interruption.  [FAQs and chitchat](#chitchat-faqs) are common generic interjections.
A contextual interjection is one whose response depends on the conversation context.
For example, if a user asks "Why do you need that?", the answer will depend on what the bot just
asked for.

### Contextual Interjections

Handling contextual interjections is similar to handling [contextual conversations](contextual-conversations.mdx)
in general.

One common case of contextual interjections is during slot filling for [form](forms.mdx), where the user
asks “Why do you need to know that?” or "Can you explain that?".
The response should differ for each slot. For example:

```yaml
User: I want to talk to sales
    Bot: Sure, we can book a sales call! Let's get to know each other first.
    Bot: What's your job?
User: Why do you need to know that?
    Bot: Your job function helps us in understanding how we can talk to you best.
    Bot: Do you still want to talk to sales?
```

Since we want the `requested_slot` to influence the conversation,
we need to make the `requested_slot` featurized, and assign it the categorical type:

```rasa-yaml
slots:
  requested_slot:
    type: categorical
    values:
      - business_email
      - company
      - person_name
      - use_case
      - budget
      - job_function
```

This means that the dialogue model will pay attention to the value of the slot when making a prediction
(read more about other [featurized slots](./domain.mdx#slots), whereas
unfeaturized slots are only used for storing information.

You can then write stories for specific responses to interruptions based on the value of `requested_slot`, for example:

```
stories:
- story: email interruption
  steps:
  - active_loop: sales_form
  - slot_was_set:
    - requested_slot: email
  - intent: ask_why_needed
  - action: utter_why_email
  - action: sales_form

- story: company interruption
  steps:
  - active_loop: sales_form
  - slot_was_set:
    - requested_slot: company
  - intent: ask_why_needed
  - action: utter_why_company
  - action: sales_form
```


## Summary

How you handle unexpected input depends on whether the response should be
context sensitive or not.

For reverting user utterances:
  - [ ] Add the RulePolicy to config.yml.
  - [ ] Define a custom action that returns `UserUtteranceReverted`
  - [ ] Define a rule for the intent that should be reverted.

For generic interjections:
  - [ ] Define rules for single-turn interactions with actions that return `UserUtteranceReverted`
  - [ ] Use the ResponseSelector for [FAQ and chitchat interruptions](chitchat-faqs.mdx)

For contextual interjections:
  - [ ] Make `requested_slot` a categorical slot (for forms)
  - [ ] Write stories for context-specific responses to interjections, using slot values where applicable
