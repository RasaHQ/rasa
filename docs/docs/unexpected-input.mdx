title: Handling Unexpected Input
abstract: One thing you can count on when building a conversational assistant is that users
  will say unexpected things. This page is a guide on handling unexpected input.
---

Unexpected input is a deviation from the [happy path](glossary.mdx#happy--unhappy-paths)
that you have defined.  For example:

- A user walks away in the middle of a conversation about their subscription, then comes back
and says "hi!"
- A user asks "Why do you need to know that?" when the bot asks for their email address.

This page is a guide on methods for handling unexpected input that is still within your bot's domain.
Depending on what kind of unexpected
input you're trying to handle, some or all of the methods describe may be applicable for you. This guide
is not about disambiguating user input or handling out-of-scope questions; for these cases see
the guide on [fallback and human handoff](fallback-handoff.mdx).


## User Interjections

There are two kinds of unexpected input: generic interjections, and contextual interjections.
Generic interjections are interruptions that should always get the same response regardless of the
conversation context. If you already have a rule defining the response to an intent, you don't
need to do anything else to handle it as an interruption.  [FAQs and chitchat](./chitchat-faqs.mdx) are common generic interjections.
A contextual interjection is one whose response depends on the conversation context.
For example, if a user asks "Why do you need that?", the answer will depend on what the bot just
asked for.

### Contextual Interjections

Handling contextual interjections is similar to handling [contextual conversations](contextual-conversations.mdx)
in general.

One common case of contextual interjections is during slot filling for [form](forms.mdx), where the user
asks “Why do you need to know that?” or "Can you explain that?".
The response should differ for each slot. For example:

<Chat caption="A contextual interjection">
<ChatUserText>Hi</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>Hello! I am restaurant search assistant! How can I help?</ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>I'm looking for a restaurant</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>What cuisine?</ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>French</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>How many people?</ChatBotText>
<ChatUserText>Why do you need to know that?</ChatUserText>
<ChatBotText>I need to know how many people are in your party to ensure the restaurant can accomodate you.</ChatBotText>
<ChatBotText>How many people?</ChatBotText>
</Chat>

Since we want the `requested_slot` to influence the conversation,
we need to set the property `influence_conversation` of the slot `requested_slot`
to `true`, and assign it the categorical type:

```yaml-rasa  title="domain.yml"
slots:
  requested_slot:
    type: categorical
    values:
      - cuisine
      - num_people
      - outdoor_seating
      - preferences
      - feedback
    influence_conversation: true
    mappings:
    - type: custom
```

This means that the dialogue model will pay attention to the value of the slot when making a prediction
(read more about how [slots influence the assistant's behaviour](./domain.mdx#slots-and-conversation-behavior)).

You can then write stories for specific responses to interjections based on the value of `requested_slot`, for example:

```yaml-rasa title="stories.yml"
stories:
- story: cuisine interjection
  steps:
  - intent: request_restaurant
  - action: restaurant_form
  - active_loop: restaurant_form
  - slot_was_set:
    - requested_slot: cuisine
  - intent: explain
  - action: utter_explain_cuisine
  - action: restaurant_form

- story: number of people interjection
  steps:
  - intent: request_restaurant
  - action: restaurant_form
  - active_loop: restaurant_form
  - slot_was_set:
    - requested_slot: num_people
  - intent: explain
  - action: utter_explain_num_people
  - action: restaurant_form
```

### UnexpecTED Intent Policy

`UNexpecTEDIntentPolicy` helps you review conversations and also allows your bot to react to unlikely user inputs.
It is an auxiliary policy that should only be used with at least one other policy, as the only that it can trigger is the special
`action_unlikely_intent` action.

`UNexpecTEDIntentPolicy` has the same model architecture as `TEDPolicy`.

The difference is at a task level. Instead of predicting the next probable action, this policy
predicts whether the last predicted intent is a likely intent according to the training stories
and conversation context.

## Summary

How you handle unexpected input depends on whether the response should be
context sensitive or not.

For generic interjections:
  - [ ] Define rules for single-turn interactions
  - [ ] Use the ResponseSelector for [FAQ and chitchat interruptions](chitchat-faqs.mdx)

For contextual interjections:
  - [ ] Make `requested_slot` a categorical slot (for forms)
  - [ ] Write stories for context-specific responses to interjections, using slot values where applicable
