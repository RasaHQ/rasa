## Getting Credentials

**How to set up Rocket.Chat:**

:::info Rocketchat Marketplace

For Rocket.Chat newest 6.x version, you can also use the official app in the Rocket.Chat Marketplace. For more info, see [Rocket.Chat Rasa App Guide](https://docs.rocket.chat/extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/rasa-app).

:::

1. Create a user that will be used to post messages, and set its
   credentials at credentials file.

2. Create a Rocket.Chat outgoing webhook by logging in as admin to
   Rocket.Chat and going to
   **Administration > Integrations > New Integration**.

3. Select **Outgoing Webhook**.

4. Set **Event Trigger** section to value **Message Sent**.

5. Fill out the details, including the channel you want the bot
   listen to. Optionally, it is possible to set the
   **Trigger Words** section with `@yourbotname` so that the bot
   doesn't trigger on everything that is said.

6. In the **URLs** section, set the URL to 
   `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rocketchat/webhook`, replacing
   the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa server.

For more information on the Rocket.Chat Webhooks, see the
[Rocket.Chat Guide](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/integrations).

## Running on RocketChat

Add the RocketChat credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
rocketchat:
  user: "yourbotname"
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  server_url: "https://demo.rocket.chat"
```

Restart your Rasa server
to make the new channel endpoint available for RocketChat to send messages to.
