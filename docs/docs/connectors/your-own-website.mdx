description: Deploy and Run a Rasa Chat Bot on a Website
---

If you just want an easy way for users to test your bot, the best option
is usually the chat interface that ships with Rasa X, where you can [invite users
to test your bot](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/share-assistant/#share-your-bot).

If you already have an existing website and want to add a Rasa assistant to it,
you can use the [Rasa Chat Widget](#chat-widget) a widget which you can incorporate into your existing webpage by adding a HTML snippet.
Alternatively, you can also build your own chat widget.

## REST Channels

The `RestInput` and `CallbackInput` channels can be used for custom integrations.
They provide a URL where you can post messages and either receive response messages
directly, or asynchronously via a webhook.

### RestInput

The REST channel will provide you with a REST endpoint where you can post
user messages and receive the assistant's messages in response.

Add the REST channel to your credentials.yml:

```yaml-rasa
rest:
  # you don't need to provide anything here - this channel doesn't
  # require any credentials
```

Restart your Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server
to make the REST channel available to receive messages. You can then send messages to 
`http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rest/webhook`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server.

#### Request and Response Format

After making the `rest` input channel available, you can `POST` messages to
`http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rest/webhook`, with the following format:

```json
{
  "sender": "test_user",  // sender ID of the user sending the message
  "message": "Hi there!"
}
```

The response from Rasa Open Source will be a JSON body of bot responses, for example:

```json
[
  {"text": "Hey Rasa!"}, {"image": "http://example.com/image.jpg"}
]
```

### CallbackInput

The Callback channel behaves very much like the REST channel,
but instead of directly returning the bot messages to the HTTP
request that sends the message, it will call a URL you can specify
to send bot messages.

To use the callback channel, add the credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
callback:
  # URL to which Core will send the bot responses
  url: "http://localhost:5034/bot"
```

Restart your Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server
to make the new channel endpoint available to receive messages. 
You can then send messages to `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/callback/webhook`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server.

#### Request and Response Format

After making the `callback` input available, you can `POST` messages to
`http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/callback/webhook` with the following format:

```json
{
  "sender": "test_user",  // sender ID of the user sending the message
  "message": "Hi there!"
}
```

If successful, the response will be `success`. Once Rasa Open Source is ready to send a
message to the user, it will call the `url` specified in your `credentials.yml` with a `POST`
request containing a JSON body of the bot's responses:

```json
[
  {"text": "Hey Rasa!"}, {"image": "http://example.com/image.jpg"}
]
```


## Websocket Channel

The SocketIO channel uses websockets and is real-time. To use the SocketIO channel, 
add the credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
socketio:
  user_message_evt: user_uttered
  bot_message_evt: bot_uttered
  session_persistence: true/false
```

The first two configuration values define the event names used by Rasa Open Source
when sending or receiving messages over socket.io.

Restart your Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server
to make the new channel endpoint available to receive messages. 
You can then send messages to `http://<host>:<port>/socket.io`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server. 

:::note session persistence
By default, the SocketIO channel uses the socket id as `sender_id`, which causes
the session to restart at every page reload. `session_persistence` can be
set to `true` to avoid that. In that case, the frontend is responsible
for generating a session id and sending it to the Rasa Core server by
emitting the event `session_request` with `{session_id: [session_id]}`
immediately after the `connect` event.

The example [Webchat](https://github.com/botfront/rasa-webchat)
implements this session creation mechanism (version >= 0.5.0).
:::

### JWT Authentication

The SocketIO channel can be optionally configured to perform JWT authentication on connect
by defining the `jwt_key` and optional `jwt_method` in the `credentials.yml` file. 

```yaml-rasa
socketio:
  user_message_evt: user_uttered
  bot_message_evt: bot_uttered
  session_persistence: true
  jwt_key: my_public_key
  jwt_method: HS256
```

When initially requesting the connection, the client should pass in an encoded payload
as a JSON object under the key `token`:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt_encoded_payload"
}
```

### Chat Widget

Once you've set up your SocketIO channel, you can use the official Rasa Chat Widget on any webpage.
Just paste the following into your site HTML and paste the URL of your Rasa instance into
the `data-websocket-url` attribute

```html
<div id="rasa-chat-widget" data-websocket-url="https://your-rasa-url-here/"></div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@rasahq/rasa-chat" type="application/javascript"></script>
```

For more information, including how to fully customize the widget for your website, you can check out the [full documentation](https://chat-widget-docs.rasa.com/).

Alternatively, if you want to embed the widget in a React app, there is
[a library in the NPM package repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rasahq/rasa-chat).
