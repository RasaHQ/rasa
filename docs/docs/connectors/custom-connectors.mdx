You can implement your own custom channel connector as a python class. You can
use the `rasa.core.channels.rest.RestInput` class as a template. 

A custom connector class must subclass `rasa.core.channels.channel.InputChannel`
and implement at least a `blueprint` and `name` method. 


## The `name` method

The `name` method defines the url prefix for the connector's webhook. It also defines the channel name you should use 
in any [channel specific response variations](../responses.mdx#channel-specific-response-variations) and the name you
should pass to the `output_channel` query parameter on the [trigger intent endpoint](https://www.rasa.com/docs/rasa/pages/http-api#operation/triggerConversationIntent).

For example, if your custom channel is named `myio`, you would define the `name` method as:

```python title=custom_channel.py
from rasa.core.channels.channel import InputChannel

class MyIO(InputChannel):
    def name() -> Text:
        """Name of your custom channel."""
        return "myio"
```

You would write a response variation specific to the `myio` channel  as:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_greet:
    - text: Hi! I'm the default greeting.
    - text: Hi! I'm the custom channel greeting
      channel: myio
```

The webhook you give to the custom channel to call would be
`http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/myio/webhook`, replacing 
the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa server.


## The `blueprint` method

The `blueprint` method
needs to create a [sanic blueprint](https://sanicframework.org/en/guide/best-practices/blueprints.html#overview)
that can be attached to a sanic server. 
Your blueprint should have at least the two routes: `health` on the route `/`,
and `receive` on the route `/webhook` (see example custom channel below).

As part of your implementation of the `receive` endpoint, you will need to tell
Rasa to handle the user message. You do this by calling 

```python
    on_new_message(
      rasa.core.channels.channel.UserMessage(
        text,
        output_channel,
        sender_id
      )
    )
```

Calling `on_new_message` will send the user message to the [`handle_message`](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/c922253fe890bb4903329d4ade764e0711d384ec/rasa/core/agent.py#L511_) method.

See more details on the `UserMessage` object [here](https://www.rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/channels/channel#usermessage-objects).

The `output_channel` argument refers to an output channel implementing the 
[`OutputChannel`](https://www.rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/channels/channel#outputchannel-objects) class. You can
either implement your own output channel class with the methods for your particular chat channel
(e.g. methods to send text and images) or you can use the
[`CollectingOutputChannel`](https://www.rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/channels/channel#collectingoutputchannel-objects) 
to collect the bot responses Rasa creates while the bot is processing your messages and return
them as part of your endpoint response. This is the way the `RestInput`
channel is implemented. For examples on how to create and use your own output
channel, take a look at the implementations of the other
output channels, e.g. the `SlackBot` in `rasa.core.channels.slack`.

Here is a simplified example of a custom channel connector that makes use of the `CollectingOutputChannel`:

```python title="custom_channel.py"
import asyncio
import inspect
from sanic import Sanic, Blueprint, response
from sanic.request import Request
from sanic.response import HTTPResponse
from typing import Text, Dict, Any, Optional, Callable, Awaitable, NoReturn

import rasa.utils.endpoints
from rasa.core.channels.channel import (
    InputChannel,
    CollectingOutputChannel,
    UserMessage,
)

class MyIO(InputChannel):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        """Name of your custom channel."""
        return "myio"

    def blueprint(
        self, on_new_message: Callable[[UserMessage], Awaitable[None]]
    ) -> Blueprint:

        custom_webhook = Blueprint(
            "custom_webhook_{}".format(type(self).__name__),
            inspect.getmodule(self).__name__,
        )

        @custom_webhook.route("/", methods=["GET"])
        async def health(request: Request) -> HTTPResponse:
            return response.json({"status": "ok"})

        @custom_webhook.route("/webhook", methods=["POST"])
        async def receive(request: Request) -> HTTPResponse:
            sender_id = request.json.get("sender") # method to get sender_id 
            text = request.json.get("text") # method to fetch text
            input_channel = self.name() # method to fetch input channel
            metadata = self.get_metadata(request) # method to get metadata

            collector = CollectingOutputChannel()
            
            # include exception handling

            await on_new_message(
                UserMessage(
                    text,
                    collector,
                    sender_id,
                    input_channel=input_channel,
                    metadata=metadata,
                )
            )

            return response.json(collector.messages)

        return custom_webhook
```

## Metadata on messages

If you need to use extra information from your front end in your custom
actions, you can pass this information using the `metadata` key of your user
message. This information will accompany the user message through the Rasa
server into the action server when applicable, where you can find it stored in
the `tracker`. Message metadata will not directly affect NLU classification
or action prediction. 

The `InputChannel` class's default implementation of `get_metadata` **ignores all metadata**.
To extract metadata in a custom connector, implement the `get_metadata` method.
The `SlackInput` channel provides one example of a `get_metadata` method that extracts metadata according to the channel's response format.

## Credentials for Custom Channels

To use a custom channel, you need to supply credentials for it in a credentials configuration file
called `credentials.yml`. 
This credentials file has to contain the **module path** (not the channel name) of your custom channel and
any required configuration parameters. 

For example, for a custom connector class called `MyIO` saved in a file `addons/custom_channel.py`, 
the module path would be `addons.custom_channel.MyIO`, and the credentials could look like:

```yaml-rasa title="credentials.yml"
addons.custom_channel.MyIO:
  username: "user_name"
  another_parameter: "some value"
```

To make the Rasa
server aware of your custom channel, specify the path to `credentials.yml` to the Rasa server at startup with the command line argument `--credentials` .


## Testing the Custom Connector Webhook

To test your custom connector, you can `POST` messages to the webhook using a json body with the following format:

```json
{
  "sender": "test_user",  // sender ID of the user sending the message
  "text": "Hi there!",
  "metadata": {}  // optional, any extra info you want to add for processing in NLU or custom actions
}
```

For a locally running Rasa server, the curl request would look like this:

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url http://localhost:5005/webhooks/myio/webhook \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
            "sender": "test_user",
            "text": "Hi there!",
            "metadata": {}
          }'
```
