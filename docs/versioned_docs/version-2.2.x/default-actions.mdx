title: Default Actions
abstract: Default actions are actions that are built into the dialogue manager by default. Most of these are automatically predicted based on certain conversation situations. You may want to customize these to personalize your assistant.
---

Each of these actions have a default behavior, described in the sections below.
In order to overwrite this default behavior, write a [custom action](./custom-actions.mdx)
whose `name()` method returns the same name as the default action:

  ```python
  class ActionRestart(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_restart"

    async def run(
        self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # custom behavior

        return [...]
  ```

Add this action to the actions section of your domain file so your assistant knows
to use the custom definition instead of the default one:

  ```yaml-rasa
  actions:
    - action_restart
  ```

## action_listen
This action is predicted to signal that the assistant should do nothing and wait
for the next user input.

## action_restart
This action resets the whole conversation history, including any slots that were
set during it.

It can be triggered by the user in a conversation by sending a
"/restart" message, if the [RulePolicy](./rules.mdx) is included in the model configuration.
If you define an `utter_restart` response in your domain, this will be sent to the user as well.

## action_session_start

This action starts a new conversation session, and is executed in the following
situations:
  * at the beginning of each new conversation
  * after a user was inactive for a period defined by the `session_expiration_time` parameter in the domain's
[session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-configuration)
  * when a user sends a "/session_start" message during a conversation

The action will reset the conversation tracker, but by default will not clear any slots that were set.

### Customization

The default behavior of the session start action is to take all existing slots and to
carry them over into the next session. Let's say you do not want to carry over all
slots, but only a user's name and their phone number. To do that, you'd override the
`action_session_start` with a custom action that might look like this:

```python
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List, Type
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet, SessionStarted, ActionExecuted, EventType


class ActionSessionStart(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_session_start"

    @staticmethod
    def fetch_slots(tracker: Tracker) -> List[EventType]:
        """Collect slots that contain the user's name and phone number."""

        slots = []
        for key in ("name", "phone_number"):
            value = tracker.get_slot(key)
            if value is not None:
                slots.append(SlotSet(key=key, value=value))
        return slots

    async def run(
      self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # the session should begin with a `session_started` event
        events = [SessionStarted()]

        # any slots that should be carried over should come after the
        # `session_started` event
        events.extend(self.fetch_slots(tracker))

        # an `action_listen` should be added at the end as a user message follows
        events.append(ActionExecuted("action_listen"))

        return events
```

## action_default_fallback

This action undoes the last user-bot interaction and sends the `utter_default` response if it is defined.
It is triggered by low action prediction confidence, if you have this [fallback mechanism](./fallback-handoff.mdx) enabled.

## action_deactivate_loop

This action deactivates the active loop and resets the requested slot. This is used when
[handling unhappy paths in forms](./forms.mdx#writing-stories--rules-for-unhappy-form-paths).

## action_revert_fallback_events

:::caution Deprecated!
The `action_revert_fallback_events` action is deprecated since the 2.0 release.
The [`action_two_stage_fallback`](./default-actions.mdx#action_two_stage_fallback) action
now handles all [two-stage fallback behavior](./fallback-handoff.mdx)
:::

## action_two_stage_fallback

This is a fallback loop that can be used to handle low NLU confidence. Read more about
[handling low NLU confidence](./fallback-handoff.mdx#nlu-fallback).

## action_default_ask_affirmation

This action is used by the `action_two_stage_fallback` loop. It asks the user to confirm
the intent of their message. This action can be customized to be more personalized
to your specific use case.

## action_default_ask_rephrase

This action is used by the `action_two_stage_fallback` loop if the user denies the
intent `action_default_ask_affirmation` displays. It asks the user to rephrase
their message.

## action_back

This action undoes the last user-bot interaction. It can be triggered by the user
by sending a "/back" message to the assistant if the [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) is configured.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
## Form Action

By default Rasa Open Source uses `FormAction` for processing any
[form logic](forms.mdx). You can override this default action with a custom action by
adding a custom action with the form's name to the domain.
Overriding the default action for forms should **only** be used during the process of
migrating from Rasa Open Source 1 to 2. In this case you can override the default
action to instruct Rasa Open Source to use the deprecated `FormAction` which is part of
the Rasa SDK.
