## Testing Channels on Your Local Machine

If you're running Rasa X Local mode or a Rasa Open Source server on `localhost`, 
most external channels won't be able to find your server URL, since `localhost` is not open to the internet. 

To make a port on your local machine publicly available on the internet, 
you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

After installing ngrok, run:

```bash
ngrok http 5005; rasa run
```

When you follow the instructions to make your assistant available on a channel, use the ngrok URL.
Specifically, wherever the instructions say to use `https://<host>:<port>/webhooks/<CHANNEL>/webhook`,
use `<ngrok_url>/<CHANNEL>/webhook`, replacing `<ngrok_url>` with the randomly generated
URL displayed in your ngrok terminal window. For example, if connecting your bot to Slack, 
your URL should resemble `https://26e7e7744191.ngrok.io/webhooks/slack/webhook`.

:::caution
With the free-tier of ngrok, you can run into limits on how many connections you can make per minute.
As of writing this, it is set to 40 connections / minute.
